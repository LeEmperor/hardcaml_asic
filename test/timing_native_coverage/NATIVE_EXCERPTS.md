# Durable native-writer grammar regressions

These excerpts were copied byte-for-byte (including backslash-newline placement)
from C's retained standalone OpenSTA 2.7.0 reports on 2026-10-28. They are parser
regressions, not new native execution or a complete audit. Tests use the local
copies and do not depend on the example checkout or its provider/PDK.

The additional `native-continued-comment-excerpt.sdc` is B's independent
A-NATIVE-R1 **Tcl-language counterexample**, not a native-writer capture. It keeps
the exact two-line continued-comment spelling from
`docs/development/pt7c-native-review.md`. `comment_check.py` sources it under
ordinary `tclsh` with inert object/false-path procedures, observing zero exception
calls, versus one for the ordinary-comment control. The production parser never
sources it: pure and hash-consistent full-audit tests require an unsupported-
continued-comment rejection. The native reader's version-2 fixtures add the
manifest top context and category-bound reports; this does not relabel C's older
version-1 native producer captures as version-2 acceptance.

The baseline resolves to six exact relations: `ena -> _4_/D` and
`rst_n -> {_2_,_3_,_4_,_5_,_6_}/RESET_B`. Test request order deliberately differs
from native serialization order. The setup-only and masking excerpts must reject
for their semantic restrictions, not tokenizer or ordinary-environment errors.
Additional mutations keep this positive baseline and exercise continuation,
derate scope/value, current-design arity/substitution, broad/extra exceptions and
continued masking. Bare newlines/semicolons inside command substitutions reject:
only the observed single-query grammar, with explicit continuations, is supported.

## A-NATIVE-R1b source-channel newline controls

`native-newline-cases.json` contains 17 durable language cases with literal newline
bytes represented by JSON escapes. `newline_check.py` decodes each state and
writes its `.sdc` bytes in **binary mode**, then sources it under ordinary `tclsh`
with inert procedures. The Tcl oracle checks false-path and disable call counts
and the exact sequence of current-design selections. These are language tests,
not native-writer captures or EDA.

The bare-CR extra-relation / masking / wrong-top variants reproduce B's R1b
counterexamples. Additional cases cover CRLF, mixed LF/CRLF, CR-only files,
indented/semicolon comments, CR outside comments and in braced values, continued
comments, and native command continuations. Tcl accepts/normalizes the relevant
source-channel newline forms; the qualified native reader now rejects **every CR
byte** before tokenization. LF-only ordinary comments and native continuations
remain positive controls; LF-exposed extra scope, masking and design changes
reject for their intended semantic diagnostics.

`check.ml` uses the same decoded states through both the pure mandatory-top API
and complete hash-consistent schema2 audits with matching manifest top, profile2,
V2 diagnostics/completion and valid resolution/application/process receipts.
Rejection cannot be attributed to an unrelated missing native context. Existing
LF native-v2 production sources remain reusable; no producer/profile change or
fresh EDA is required by this reader-only grammar restriction.
