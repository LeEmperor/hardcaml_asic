    preserves its signal-derived status and successful transport is never mapped.
    The default preserves process statuses. CLI4 uses 2 for timeout/publication
    validation errors, matching its historical exception convention. *)

(** Production requires Docker and the exact demonstrated image. Compatibility
    has the existing seven fields and must bind these exact paths/runtime/bridge.
    Workspace, project, PDK, store and candidates directory already exist; project
    and store are disjoint descendants of the mounted workspace. No adoption,
     copying, directory creation or runtime readiness inference. Optional runtime
      verifier runs before and after each successful backend call; preparation
      supplies bound engine/image re-probes. [verify_inputs] retains an independent
      checked input baseline; it runs at validation, before/after successful calls,
      at publication entry and immediately before promotion. [verify_resolved]
      checks each candidate/staging resolved.json against the selected contract.
      Named Stage_preparation supplies both; defaults preserve ordinary callers.
      Stable trusted parents and exclusive workspace use are still required; these
       checks do not make arbitrary adversarial filesystem races impossible. *)
(* [workers] defaults to6 and admits1..6; the qualified bridge bounds its native
   executor/tool settings to6 (STA1). [cancel] is forwarded to every supervised
   backend call, including publication validation, and polled by execute. *)

(** Source is taken only from Runner context. Each invocation revalidates it,
    resources, reply correlation and artifact bytes. Publication rechecks the

    Checkpoint_publisher. Only successful atomic publication advances Runner.
    Requests/replies use TAG-request.json / TAG-reply.json in project; merged logs
    use TAG.log in workspace. All request/log writes are exclusive and retained.
    Tags are boundary-32hex or validate-boundary-32hex, matching Python.
    TAG-transport.json and TAG-transport-result.json in workspace are exclusive
    immutable launch/terminal evidence correlated to the request identity. The
    launch is recorded before execution; terminal evidence includes primary
    process and all cleanup outcomes, including successful cleanup. Binding,
    argv, owned container, host UID/GID, explicit resources and timestamps are
    retained; the ambient environment is never serialized. Recording failure
    vetoes success and is secondary to an existing process failure/cancellation. *)
