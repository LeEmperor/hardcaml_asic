(** Main-thread synchronous scope. Uses Process_supervisor for launch and every
    removal. After clean client completion, one successful removal or definitive
    absence ends cleanup. Failed removal retries within a separate deadline
    (default 5s). Uncertain launch/nonzero/signal/timeout/cancellation retries
    throughout that deadline, even after absence, to cover in-flight daemon
    creation. A daemon committing after that deadline cannot be
    ruled out: cleanup is bounded, not an atomic Docker cancellation protocol.
    Retries are spaced by up to 50ms; no attempt starts in the final 150ms reserved
    for engine startup. Success records the last removal/absence observation,
    not a transactional absence guarantee. Budgets <=150ms cannot prove cleanup.
    Removal uses cwd / and the launch's cleared environment, so a missing/deleted
    project directory does not prevent cleanup.
    Removal diagnostics are capped at 8192 bytes. Cleanup errors veto success but
    preserve primary exit/signal/timeout/failure; new cleanup signals veto success.
    Invalid durations are rejected before launch. No shell, pull, tag resolution,
    resource copying, image/engine probing or publication occurs. *)
