(* Where a design is going: a declared harness and technology pair, and the resolved
   target that pair stands for.

   {v
   Project.create ~target        declared pair; accepted as is, the pair is NOT checked
   Project.elaborate             uses [technology] for resource selection only
   Project.elaborate_for_flow    Resolved_build.resolve -> Target.resolve
                                 -> unsupported pair or bad inputs: Error
                                 -> Resolved.t: geometry, floorplan, pins, layers, views
   Bundle                        writes the Resolved.t references into the manifest
   v}

   Resolution is deterministic: the same pair and inputs always give an equal
   {!Resolved.t}. Only Tiny Tapeout [T6x4] with {!Technology.ihp_sg13cmos5l} resolves;
   every other pair is an error, even ones {!Project.elaborate} accepts.

   A resolved target records references to external files by revision, relative path and
   (for the floorplan) hash. It does NOT open, fetch or hash any of them; checking them
   against a real support-tools checkout and PDK is P4 preflight. It does NOT check the
   design either; the TT top-level interface, metadata, pinout and timing are checked by
   {!Resolved_build.resolve}.
