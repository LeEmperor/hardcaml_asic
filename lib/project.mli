   Elaboration never invokes an external tool. Each call is independent: a failed
   elaboration leaves nothing behind for the next one. [elaborate_for_flow]
   applies target, interface, constraint, and adapter validation to an
   implementation elaboration before flow emission.

(* we're saying that a Design module implements the following items;

   It has a module I and O that implement the capabilities of Hardcaml.Interface;

   It has a "name" member and a function "create" that follows a certain signature.
   Therefore anything that implements these functions, and has the members can be counted
   on as a "Design".

  (* A design must have a create function; different from standard is the elaboration
     context that is required for ASIC items. This may be for simulation though, or even
     emultaion, meaning an elaboration context varies by target we're shooting.

(** First-class preparation, independent of bundle publication and physical stages.
    Observes declared sources before and after, elaborates Implementation exactly
    once, resolves once, and hashes actual RTL in memory. No Simulation elaboration,
    Bundle.render, EDA, or PDK reads. Source changes reject success. These declared
    file observations do not prove compiled-source consistency or a P6 stamp.

(** [methodology] applies only checked configurable assignments, after project
    assignments, in methodology-default/profile/request order. Other project
    overrides and the project's flow remain authoritative. No declaration is
    mutated. Without it the legacy settings and emitted bytes are unchanged. *)

    elaborate Implementation and resolve, optionally elaborate Simulation (default
    true), then [Bundle.render]. Reads source inventory and Git as documented by

    previewed with [Bundle.identity] and then passed directly to [Bundle.publish]

(** Emit using [elaborate_for_flow ?inputs], optional Simulation elaboration,
    [Bundle.render], then [Bundle.write], returning the written bundle.
    An empty source inventory fails before invoking the design; it does not prevent
    ordinary elaboration. [include_simulation] defaults to true. When false, no
    Simulation construction occurs and Bundle uses synthesis sources for simulation.

    This explicit I/O boundary reads declared source files and Git during rendering.
    Nothing is written before rendering succeeds. Inherits Bundle.write's new/empty
    output directory requirement and non-atomic writes: a write failure can leave a
    partial directory. No external flow tools or PDK reads are performed. *)

    by [Bundle.publish]. Returns the rendered bundle and its absolute publication
    location/reuse result. An empty inventory fails before design construction;
    render failure leaves no store output. The caller supplies the store location
    (typically [<results-root>/bundles]); no root is inferred by the library.
    Inherits Bundle.publish's exact reuse, backing layout and atomic visibility. *)
