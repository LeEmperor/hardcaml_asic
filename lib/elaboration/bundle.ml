(* University of Florida *)
(* Author: Bohdan Purtell *)
(* Module: "elaboration/bundle.ml" *)
(* Source implementation of the TT/LibreLane project bundle. A bundle is the answer to
   "what exactly would be handed to the flow, and where did every byte come from?";

   It is an in-memory list of files plus a manifest describing them. [render] builds one
   out of a Resolved.t (and optionally a Simulation Elaborated_project.t),
   reading the declared source inputs and git state under [source_root]; [write] then puts
   it on disk. examples/tt_bundle_example.ml is the caller today: it runs
   Project.elaborate_for_flow and Project.elaborate ~mode:Simulation, renders, writes, and
   prints the identity.

   Rendering and writing are split on purpose: everything that decides the bundle's
   contents happens in [render], without touching the output directory, so a bundle can be
   inspected through [file], [paths] and [manifest] before anything lands on disk, and a
   render failure (a missing input, no git commit) writes nothing.

   It does NOT validate the design, the target or the settings; Elaboration.Resolved
   already did, and this module leans on those guarantees (one clock on "clk", nonempty
   views, no override of a generated setting). It does NOT run any EDA tool, touch the PDK
   or link the TT support-tools checkout at OUTPUT/tt; running the flow is P4 work. Layout
   and manifest fields are described in docs/guides/bundle-emission.md.

(* Render constraints/top.sdc; the clock, the target's constraint environment, and a max
   and a min line per declared I/O delay;

   The clock name and port are both hardcoded to "clk"; that is safe because
   Resolved.validate_timing only accepts exactly one clock, on "clk". Delays arrive
   already sorted by port from the same function, and the port lists below are sorted
   here, so the file is deterministic;

   Numbers print with "%.17g", enough digits to round trip any float exactly, so the SDC
   period is the same number as CLOCK_PERIOD in config.json (test/check_bundle.py checks
   this) rather than a rounded neighbour. A consequence: a value with no exact binary
   form prints all of it, so a 5% derate writes -early 0.94999999999999996, which is the
   number the flow would have used either way;

   Both delay bounds are always written. A "-max" line alone leaves hold unconstrained, so
   STA finds no hold paths and the resizer inserts no hold buffers (see Timing);

   WHY the environment lines are here at all: Bundle.config sets PNR_SDC_FILE and
   SIGNOFF_SDC_FILE to this file, which stops LibreLane's FALLBACK_SDC (base.sdc) from
   ever running, and that script is the only place LibreLane applies uncertainty,
   transition, derate, driving cell, load and fanout. Without them a path through an
   input buffer has no input slew, no variation margin and no uncertainty, and hold is
   analysed optimistically: the reference observable design closed hold at +0.01 ns
   without these lines and at -0.24 ns with them, which is the violation the post-CTS
   resizer is supposed to repair.

   Deliberately absent: set_propagated_clock. LibreLane's read_current_sdc
   (scripts/openroad/common/io.tcl) greps this file for "set_propagated_clock" and
   "unset_propagated_clock", and applies the right one per step when it finds neither:
   ideal clocks for pre-CTS analysis, propagated clocks after CTS. Writing either here
   would pin every step to one of them.

   Also absent: set_max_transition and set_max_capacitance. The pinned PDK leaves
   MAX_TRANSITION_CONSTRAINT and MAX_CAPACITANCE_CONSTRAINT unset, so base.sdc would not
   have written them either, and the Liberty's own limits apply.

(* The main sauce here for bundles; given a resolved flow, produce every file of the
   bundle and a manifest that pins down where each byte came from;

   1. [simulation_project], if given, must be a Simulation elaboration of the same project and
      top module -> otherwise error;
   2. generate synthesis RTL from the resolved flow's elaborated project, and simulation
      RTL from [simulation_project] when there is one;
   3. dedup and sort [input_paths]; none left -> error;
   4. read git HEAD of [source_root] -> error when there is no repository or no commit;
   5. read every input's bytes (see [read_input]) and its git status -> every input that
      fails is reported in one combined error; an input whose read fails skips its git
      status;
   6. collect produced and copied files, sorted by path;
   7. build the manifest payload and hash it into the identity;
   8. prepend the identity to the payload, and append "manifest.json" to the files;

   Returns Or_error rather than raising since it reads the file system and runs git after
   elaboration is over, where a missing input is an ordinary user mistake; the example
   decides to [ok_exn]. Nothing is written on any path, success or failure;

   The identity is the SHA-256 of the compact payload, which is everything in the manifest
   except the identity itself. It covers the git revision, each input's git status and
   content hash, and every emitted file's hash, so the same design rendered from a
   different commit or a dirty tree gets a different identity -> see test/check_bundle.py.

   A consequence: the payload's field ORDER is part of the identity. Reordering fields,
   renaming one, or bumping a requested tool version below changes every identity even
   when no design changed; bump "schema_version" when that is intended.

   Careful: without [simulation_project], "simulation_sources" points at the synthesis RTL
   under src/, and "simulation_resources" is empty. A simulation consumer then compiles
