(* Module: "elaboration/resolved.mli" *)
(* Validated TT/LibreLane resolution results for Bundle and design observers.

   Only [resolve], also called by Project.elaborate_for_flow, constructs a result.
   Private records preserve field reads and pattern matching but forbid construction
   and record updates. There is no unchecked constructor or deserializer.

   Resolution checks the target first, then combines wrapper port, submission metadata,
   pinout and implementation capability diagnostics in one stage. Timing is checked
   next, followed by settings and protected overrides. It relies on Elaborated_project's
   declaration/elaboration invariants; it does not freeze Hardcaml circuit internals
   or verify external target files. Bundle owns emission.

(** Resolve an implementation elaboration; defaults to {!Target.Inputs.reference_cmos5l_6x4}.
     Returns an error on unsupported targets, missing capabilities, invalid wrapper,
     metadata, pinout or timing, or overrides of protected facts. No files are read.
     A failure stops subsequent validation stages; no partial result is returned.

     With [methodology], precedence is provider-derived defaults, existing project
     assignments, methodology defaults, profile, then request. All inherited values
     for configurable keys must pass the strict typed domain even if replaced.
     Unconfigurable project settings retain their raw values and ownership; catalog
     assignments have already been gated by the checked snapshot. Protected facts
     remain authoritative. [effective_parameters] records actual values and complete
     replaced project/catalog history; unspecified runtime defaults remain absent.
     The snapshot's endpoint/stages are retained for subsequent plan construction;
     this seam does not replace the project's [Flow.t] or its execution recipe. *)
