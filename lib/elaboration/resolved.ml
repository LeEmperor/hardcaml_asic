(* Source implementation of the flow resolution boundary. A resolved flow answers
   "is this elaborated project ready for TT/LibreLane, and with which settings?";

   Project.elaborate_for_flow elaborates in Implementation mode and hands the project to
   [resolve]. That calls Target.resolve for the pinned target, checks the TT top-level
   interface, the metadata, Pinout.validate_tiny_tapeout and the technology capabilities,
   converts the clock and I/O delays to nanoseconds, and merges the Flow LibreLane
   overrides over the settings it derives; Bundle then renders the result into the SDC,
   info.yaml, config.json and the manifest.

   Every fact here comes from one Project declaration, its elaborated circuit and the
   Target inputs; nothing is read from disk.

   It does NOT emit anything, that is Bundle's job, and it does NOT open or hash the files
   the target references; Bundle only records their pinned hashes. It is TT/LibreLane
   specific on purpose: the wrapper port names, the single "clk" clock and the protected
   keys all belong to that pair. Stock exact SRAM collateral is supported for
   synthesis; physical macro execution is explicitly gated pending verification.

   Careful: a port in the wrong direction is reported twice. The Wrong_direction fixture
   declares "rst_n" as an output, so the input check reports it as the wrong direction
   AND the output check reports it as unexpected. That is noise, not a missed error.

   returns Or_error rather than raising since [resolve] binds it after its other checks;

   1. exactly one clock, on "clk" -> otherwise error, and no delay is checked at all;
   2. per delay list, every delay whose maximum is not finite or is negative -> error;
   3. otherwise, every delay whose minimum is not finite or exceeds its maximum -> error;
   4. otherwise, every delay on "clk" or on a port not in that direction -> error;
   5. a port delayed more than once in the same list -> error; only the first repeat
      found is reported;
   6. no errors -> sort by port and convert both bounds to nanoseconds;

   Steps 2 to 5 run for both lists, and every problem found is reported in one combined
   error. Steps 2 to 4 are one if/else chain, so a delay with a bad bound and a bad port
   only reports the bound.

   A negative minimum is accepted on purpose: it is how SDC models an output feeding a
   receiver with a hold time, or an input that may change before the clock edge.

   NOT checked: a maximum longer than the clock period, and a delay on a phantom input
   (those are real wrapper ports, see [ports]); both are accepted as declared.

   Anything containing "SDC" is protected too, see [protected_key].

   WHY the timing keys are protected rather than merely unused: with PNR_SDC_FILE set,
   LibreLane's base.sdc never runs, so the four purely analytical ones
   (CLOCK_UNCERTAINTY_CONSTRAINT, CLOCK_TRANSITION_CONSTRAINT, TIME_DERATING_CONSTRAINT,
   IO_DELAY_CONSTRAINT) reach nothing at all and an override of one would silently do
   nothing. The others are worse: synthesis reads SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL and OUTPUT_CAP_LOAD
   straight out of the configuration (it writes its own small ABC SDC from them), and ABC
   reads MAX_FANOUT_CONSTRAINT and MAX_TRANSITION_CONSTRAINT, so an override would change
   what synthesis optimises for while [Bundle.sdc] still analysed the target's values.
   A project that needs different values passes them through Target.Inputs, where they are
   checked and recorded as Target owned -> see Technology.Cmos5l.Constraints.

   Careful: this list is separate from what [resolve_settings] derives. A new derived
   setting whose key is not added here can be silently replaced by an override; that is
   only intended for the Default owned ones (FP_SIZING, RUN_LINTER).

   The substring match is broad on purpose: timing constraints only come from Timing and
   Clock through Bundle.sdc, and Bundle.config generates PNR_SDC_FILE and
   SIGNOFF_SDC_FILE, so every SDC related key ("PNR_SDC_FILE", "SIGNOFF_SDC_FILE", ...)
   is rejected without listing each one;

(* Derive the LibreLane settings and merge the overrides over them; returns Or_error
   rather than raising since [resolve] binds it as its last check;

   1. derive a setting per design, target and clock fact, plus two Default ones;
   2. pull the overrides out of the flow adapter;
   3. any override on a protected key -> error, every conflict reported together;
   4. drop each derived setting an override replaces, then add the overrides, owned by
      Override with their reason;
   5. sort by key;

   Why one setting per key: derived keys are distinct by construction, Flow.validate
   already rejected overrides that repeat a key, and step 4 drops every derived setting
   an override shares a key with. After step 3 only FP_SIZING and RUN_LINTER can be
   dropped that way.

   Careful: DIE_AREA prints each bound with "%.12g", so a coordinate with more than 12
   significant digits is rounded in the config; real TT die areas are far from that.

   Six of the Target settings restate the constraint environment Bundle.sdc renders. They
   are derived rather than left out because LibreLane reads three of them outside the SDC
   (SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL and OUTPUT_CAP_LOAD in synthesis, MAX_FANOUT_CONSTRAINT in ABC), so
   omitting them would let synthesis optimise against the PDK's values while analysis used
   the target's. The other three reach nothing while PNR_SDC_FILE is set; they are written
   anyway so config.json states the same environment the SDC applies, and so they still
   agree if a later LibreLane reads them. Every one of the ten keys involved is protected
   -> see [protected_keys].

(* The main sauce here for flow resolution; given an Implementation elaboration, check it
   against the TT/LibreLane flow and return everything Bundle needs;

   1. resolve the target -> an unsupported harness and technology pair stops here, with
      nothing else checked;
   2. check the interface, metadata, pinout and capabilities, every problem reported in
      one combined error;
   3. [validate_timing] -> resolved clock and delays;
   4. [resolve_settings] -> merged settings;
   5. assemble, deriving [clock_hz] from the period;

   Steps are bound in order, so a failure in one hides the ones after it; a protected
   override is only reported once the interface and timing are clean.

   Metadata author and description are checked here, not in Metadata.validate, which
   only requires a title; a TT submission needs both, a project that only simulates
   does not.

   Returns Or_error rather than raising since it runs after elaboration, outside any
   design constructor; Project.elaborate_for_flow tags the error with the project name.
   [inputs] passes straight through to Target.resolve, which defaults it to
