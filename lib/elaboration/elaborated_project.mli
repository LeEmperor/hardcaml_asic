(* Module: "elaboration/elaborated_project.mli" *)
(* The immutable result of one successful project elaboration.

   An elaborated project can be inspected without running any tool. It keeps design intent
   (metadata, target selection, clocks, resource inventory) separate from adapter
   settings. It contains an elaborated Hardcaml circuit, NOT a synthesis result or a
   LibreLane configuration; {!Bundle.render} renders the latter.

   Nothing can be added after finalization: the elaboration context that produced it
   is closed. A failed elaboration produces no elaborated project at all.

   The TT/LibreLane resolution result is a separate {!Resolved.t}. The
   bundle renderer consumes that validated result and emits flattened RTL and
   provenance. Hierarchical RTL emission is deferred.
