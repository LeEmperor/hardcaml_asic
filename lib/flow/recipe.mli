(** Fresh sequences start at synthesis. Resumed sequences start immediately after
    [initial_boundary]. Empty, skipped, repeated and reordered stages fail here. The
    provider must also validate the supplied checkpoint's actual source and compatibility
    before execution. *)

(** Historical six-stage decoding only; this does not authorize bridge execution. *)

(** Expand all stages through the endpoint, optionally from an explicit source. A terminal
    source or an endpoint at/before the source fails. *)

(** Join validated recipes when the second recipe's source is exactly the first recipe's
    endpoint. This composes declarations, not executions or historical checkpoint sets;
    finalization of resumed attempts is a separate contract. *)
