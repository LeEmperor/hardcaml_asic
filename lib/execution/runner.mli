(** Checks initial handoff presence/boundary for schema 2/3; [validate] checks real
    compatibility. IDs are nonempty Unicode, NUL/slash-free. Invalid ID raises
    before callbacks. Ordinary callback exceptions become failure/2;
    [Callback_error] retains explicit interruption. All callback errors are facts.
    No preallocation exception escapes as it does in Python's run adapter.

    [persist] sees an immutable early running snapshot before invocation, each
    lifecycle transition, and terminal status. Initial save failure prevents work.
    First non-best-effort failure wins; later failures remain secondary. Failed
    coarse run/postcheck still permits best-effort collection when a run exists.
    Interrupted services with a run also permit best-effort collection, as in
    Python. Cancellation reported by [cancel] blocks all later actions. [cancel]
    is polled before actions and after invoke/publication; in-flight callbacks own
    supervised cancellation.
    Finished hooks run even if started/invoke/published fails. Promoted artifacts
    survive later hook failures; no rollback/retry. [observe] sees returned
    postcheck outcomes only. Finite nondecreasing clock, six-decimal duration.
    Hooks are coarse service facts, never simulated backend step observations. *)
