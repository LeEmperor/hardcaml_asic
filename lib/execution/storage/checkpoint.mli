    Schema 2 requires the exact tested image even without a restart request.
    [location] is solely the existing private-candidate/final-location check used
    by a future publisher; it does not grant relocation of retained checkpoints.
    Internal file and directory symlinks are rejected, including dangling links.
    External host files retain the Python validator's symlink-following behavior.
    Native state bytes are hashed verbatim. A private read-only syntax projection
    checks only view leaves and the metrics-object container; native nonfinite
    tokens, including exponent overflow, are permitted inside metrics. No native
    metric values are exposed or serialized. The projection uses the codec's
    Unicode/depth/duplicate-key restrictions; it is not a native state writer. *)
