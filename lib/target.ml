(* Module: "target.ml" *)
(* Source implementation of target selection and resolution. A target is the project's
   answer to "where is this design going?", and a resolved target is the answer to "what
   exactly does that place look like?";

   The declaration is two separately selected axes, a harness and a technology, handed to
   Project.create as one record. Project.elaborate takes [technology] out of it to create
   the Elaboration_context, and Build carries the whole record through. Only
   Project.elaborate_for_flow goes further: Resolved_build.resolve calls [resolve] on
   Build.target, and the Resolved.t it gets back supplies the target owned LibreLane
   settings (die area, floorplan, power pins, routing layer) and the references Bundle
   writes into its manifest;

   Resolution is a lookup, not a computation. Every fact in a Resolved.t was read off the
   pinned support-tools and PDK revisions by hand and written down here or in
   Technology.Cmos5l (see docs/target-reference.md), so resolving the same pair twice
   gives the same record -> see test/test_target.ml;

   It does NOT open, fetch or hash any file; paths and hashes are recorded as given, and
   checking them against a real checkout is P4 preflight. It does NOT look at the design
   either; TT top-level ports, metadata, pinout and timing are Resolved_build's job.
   Project.create still does not check the pair (see its TODO), so an unsupported pair is
   only caught when someone asks for a flow.

(* The selected pair;

   harness    : what the design is packaged into, and what its top level must look like;
   technology : what the design is built out of, and which macros exist;

   Careful: this is a declaration, NOT a resolved target. Any harness can be paired with
   any technology here, including combinations nobody supports; Project.elaborate accepts
   them, and only [resolve] (through Project.elaborate_for_flow) rejects them.

   Careful: nothing in the type stops [x_max] being below [x_min]. [validate_inputs]
   checks the die area it is handed, but the mli does NOT make the record private, so a
   rectangle built anywhere else is not checked at all.

   needs that the Harness and Technology constructors do not say;

   floorplan_path         : the 6x4 block DEF, relative to the support-tools checkout;
   floorplan_sha256       : expected hash of that DEF, lowercase hex;
   die_area_um            : die bounds; should agree with tile_sizes.yaml at
                            [support_tools_revision];
   technology_views       : the PDK views to reference, relative to the PDK checkout;

   Transparent on purpose, so a caller pinning different revisions can start from
   [reference_cmos5l_6x4] and override fields with { base with ... } -> see
   test/test_target.ml; [validate_inputs] is what keeps a hand-built record honest.

   Careful: "should agree" above is not checked by anything. [validate_inputs] checks the
   shape of each field (hex, relative, finite), never whether a revision actually has
   that path, that hash or that die area. Inputs with a wrong hash or die area resolve
   fine; nothing can notice before P4 preflight, the first step that opens the files.

   Why: references are joined onto a checkout root later, so ".." or an absolute path

   several spellings;

   Careful: the check is purely textual. Leading whitespace (" /abs", " a.def") and

(* Everything wrong with a constraint environment, as one sentence each; empty when it is

   driving cell    : both halves nonblank and free of "/", so LibreLane's "<cell>/<pin>"
                     spelling splits back into exactly these two;
   load            : finite and nonnegative; a negative load is not a capacitance;
   fanout          : positive; zero would forbid every net;
   uncertainty     : finite and nonnegative; a negative one would hand setup free time;
   clock transition: finite and nonnegative, same reason;
   derate          : finite, nonnegative and below 100, so the early multiplier
                     1 - derate/100 stays positive; at 100 every early path takes no time
                     at all, and above it delays go negative;

   NOT checked: whether [driving_cell] is a cell the technology's Liberty actually
   defines, or whether [driving_cell_pin] is one of its output pins. This module opens no
   file, so a cell that does not exist validates fine here and is first caught when
   OpenSTA reads the SDC; checking it against an installed PDK is P4 preflight work.

   Careful: the floorplan path is compared against a fixed string, so a caller supplying

   different revisions, and it reaches here from Project.elaborate_for_flow through
   Resolved_build.resolve. Inputs are only validated once the pair is supported, so an
   unsupported pair reports that alone, even when [inputs] is broken too.

   Why the name AND the empty mapping list: Technology.t is private and create_exn
   refuses the name "ihp-sg13cmos5l", so the name alone already means
   Technology.ihp_sg13cmos5l; the mapping check keeps the guard honest if that
   reservation is ever dropped, since a CMOS5L technology with macros is not what the
   views and settings below describe -> see test/test_target.ml;

   Most resolved facts are constants of this one pair, not inputs: the tile string,
   "VPWR"/"VGND" from the pinned project.py, and the cell power pins, routing layers and
   corner from Technology.Cmos5l. A consequence: changing any of those takes a code
   change here or in Technology; passing different [inputs] cannot.

  (* Every other pair: other tile sizes on CMOS5L, and any other technology;

     TODO (future fix): the ~tiles label carries the whole Harness.t rather than the
     tiles, so it prints (tiles (Tiny_tapeout (tiles T1x1))); ~harness would say what it
     is. Changing it changes expect test output (test/test_target.ml), so update those
     in the same commit;
