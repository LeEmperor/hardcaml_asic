"""Curated evidence archive for one finished TT/LibreLane run directory.

A run directory is ~235 MB, most of it intermediate stage state and redundant
layout formats (odb, mag, mag_gds) that nothing reads again. This copies the
immutable records out, tars the reports an acceptance decision is read from
together with the two final artifacts a resubmission or a re-check needs, and
preserves the complete verified immutable input bundle in input-bundle.tar.gz.

What is kept is an explicit list, not a size rule. What belongs in evidence is
decided by what a reader has to check; a size threshold would silently drop a new
report the first time a flow stage grew one, and silently admit a big one.

Deliberately NOT kept: the compiled gate-level simulator (checks/*/gate.out, 9 MB
of iverilog output) and every intermediate stage directory. Both are rebuildable
from what is kept plus the pinned toolchain, and neither is read by a check.

Careful: this does not write the README.md that sits beside the records in
evidence/p4/*. That note is the human account of what the run showed, and a
generated stand-in would read as though someone had checked the result.

Usage:
  scripts/archive.py RUN_DIR --output evidence/p4/observable-physical
  scripts/archive.py RUN_DIR --output DIR --force   # replace a populated DIR
  scripts/archive.py RUN_DIR --list                 # print the selection, write nothing
