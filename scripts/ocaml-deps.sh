# OCaml layer of the bootstrap: the opam switch and the packages dune needs. Everything
# else in this repository goes through dune, and dune needs this, so it is plain shell
# with no dependency on the repository having been built. See bootstrap.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ocaml-deps.sh              # check and print the commands that fix gaps
#   scripts/ocaml-deps.sh --install    # create the switch and install what is missing
#
# The switch is shared with every other Hardcaml checkout on the machine (the reference
# setup has a dozen under ~/devel/jane), so the default is to check and report. Changes
# happen only with --install, and only ever add: nothing here upgrades, downgrades or
# recompiles a package another checkout depends on.
#
# This repository has a generated opam package for consumers. The bootstrap check
# still names all repo build/test dependencies, including examples and test libraries,
# because it checks the shared switch without installing the package into it.
#
# Careful: the list has to be updated by hand when a dune file gains a library. The cost
# of missing one is a clear dune error at build time ("Library X not found"), not a wrong
# result, so it is checked rather than generated.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  the switch exists and has every package
#   2  something is missing; the commands that fix it are printed

Usage: scripts/ocaml-deps.sh [--install]

Checks that the OxCaml opam switch exists and has the packages this repository's dune
files name. Changes nothing unless --install is given.

Options:
  --install    Create the switch if it is missing (about 30 minutes) and install missing
               packages into it. Installed packages are never upgraded or recompiled.
  -h, --help   Show this message.

Environment:
  OPAM_SWITCH  Switch to use. Default: 5.2.0+ox
