# TT/CMOS5L bundle emission

Emission turns one validated project declaration into an immutable Tiny Tapeout
project directory (a *bundle*). It never runs synthesis or hardening, invokes EDA
tools or reads a PDK. Running a bundle is covered in
[execution and results](flow.md).

## Project-centered entry point

The consumer owns a project constructor: the FIFO specimen exposes
`Fifo_asic.project () : Hardcaml_asic.Project.t Core.Or_error.t` and `Tt_wrapper`
through its facade. Its `asic/project.ml` owns the declaration and source
inventory, and `bin/project.ml` supplies `describe`, `emit`, `preflight` and
implementation-only `run` (plus `flow plan|run` for [named flows](named-flows.md)).
The shared emission orchestration belongs to `Hardcaml_asic.Project.emit_bundle`.

OCaml consumer code (inside a function with `source_root` and `output_dir` arguments):

```ocaml
let open Core.Or_error.Let_syntax in
let%bind project = Fifo_asic.project () in
Hardcaml_asic.Project.emit_bundle project ~source_root ~output_dir
```

Shell commands, from the example checkout after
[development refresh and activation](../development/consumer-dependency-workflow.md#implemented-commands):

```sh
dune exec bin/project.exe -- describe
dune exec bin/project.exe -- emit
# Machine callers request JSON explicitly; exact destination override:
dune exec bin/project.exe -- emit \
  --source-root "$PWD" --output-dir /tmp/fifo-project-bundle --json
```

`describe` prints a local S-expression of declaration facts, including the top name
and inventory. It does not construct the design, resolve a flow, read Git/files/PDKs
or write output. `describe --json` wraps the declaration S-expression and actual
project name; neither format is a Workbench observation protocol. `emit` defaults
to verified identity-addressed publication and a human created/reused summary;
`--json` prints `identity` and `output_dir`. Explicit `--output-dir` retains ordinary
writing. `preflight` and `run` emit/reuse current sources unless given `--bundle`,
then route to the installed provider. Run requires a stage and performs implementation
only. See the [command/storage matrix](flow.md#default-result-store-and-cli-contract-4)
for roots, JSON migration, persistence and separate existing-run operations.

`Project.create ?source_inputs` defaults to `[]`; `Project.source_inputs` returns
the declaration unchanged, including order and duplicates. Source paths belong to
the project; the source root and output directory are execution arguments. Creation
does not read or validate source files, and ordinary elaboration needs no inventory.

`Project.emit_bundle ?inputs ?include_simulation t ~source_root ~output_dir` rejects
an empty inventory before invoking the design. It then performs implementation
elaboration/resolution (forwarding optional `Target.Inputs.t`), optional Simulation
elaboration, `Bundle.render`, and finally `Bundle.write`. `include_simulation`
defaults to `true`; `false` skips Simulation construction and uses the synthesis
source set for simulation, without a separately elaborated simulation file.
The example CLI uses the default. Rendering owns source canonicalization, Git
provenance and input validation. No output is written before rendering succeeds.
Writing requires a new/empty destination and is non-atomic: a write failure can
leave partial output. No external flow tools or PDK reads occur during emission.

### Identity-addressed publication

The library entry for a caller-owned results store is:

```ocaml
Project.emit_bundle_to_store ?inputs ?include_simulation project
  ~source_root ~store_dir
(* (Bundle.t * Bundle.Publication.t) Core.Or_error.t *)
```

The caller supplies `store_dir`, typically `<results-root>/bundles`; the library
does not infer a results root or search the working directory. Relative explicit
roots are accepted, and `Publication.directory` is the absolute public path
`<store_dir>/<Bundle.identity bundle>`. `Publication.t` is a private record with
readable `directory : string` and `reused : bool` fields. The project entry owns
the same implementation/resolution, optional Simulation and render sequence as
explicit emission, with the same early empty-inventory rejection and defaults.
Consumers call this entry once rather than duplicating elaboration. Lower-level
callers with an already rendered bundle can use
`Bundle.publish bundle ~store_dir : Bundle.Publication.t Core.Or_error.t`.
The example CLI defaults to `ROOT/_flow_results/bundles`; the installed
provider separately defaults to the caller's cwd for run/operation storage.
`Project.emit_bundle ~output_dir` and `Bundle.write` retain their explicit
new/empty-directory semantics.

On local POSIX filesystems the backing layout is:

```text
<store_dir>/
  .objects/<identity>.<unique>/   complete bundle, no additional receipt
  <identity> -> .objects/<identity>.<unique>
```

An exclusively allocated object is fully written and verified before an exclusive
symlink creates the public identity name. That operation never replaces an existing
file, link or directory, even an empty directory. Concurrent publishers of the same
bundle produce one creation and verified reuse; losers clean up only their own
unpublished objects. Published objects must be retained. Exceptions during writing
leave no public partial bundle. There is no store cleanup/GC (including objects left
by an abruptly killed process), mutable current pointer, physical cache or resume.

Reuse compares the **entire path set and exact bytes**, including `manifest.json`.
Extra files, extra empty directories, missing/corrupt bytes and symlinked members
are rejected without changing the existing destination. Exact pre-existing plain
directories are supported. Existing root links must point directly to a real,
identity-prefixed child of `.objects`; escaping/dangling links, linked backing
objects, symlinked store ancestors and file-valued parents fail with diagnostics.
Store contents must remain stable against external mutation while publishing or
verifying. This API makes no fsync/power-loss durability or NFS guarantees and adds
no runtime Python or EDA requirement. Generated bytes, identity and schemas are
identical to explicit emission. Preflight and run canonicalize the root link
before use, and the archiver verifies and packages the underlying bundle files.

## Lower-level composition and provider examples

`Project.elaborate` returns an abstract `Elaborated_project.t` containing the
Hardcaml circuit, metadata, intent and resources. `Project.elaborate_for_flow`
performs implementation elaboration and `Resolved_flow.resolve`, producing
validated concrete TT/LibreLane facts plus the `elaborated_project` field.
`Bundle.render ~source_root ~input_paths resolved_flow` renders that result;
its optional `~simulation_project` takes a separate Simulation elaboration.
`Bundle.write` writes the bundle, and execution happens separately.
(These names replaced `Build`/`Resolved_build` without changing persisted keys,
schema or hashing; see the [API migration](../phase_plan.md#public-api-rename-migration-and-evidence).)

From this repository's root:

```sh
dune build
dune exec examples/tt_bundle_example.exe -- observable /tmp/asic-observable
dune exec examples/tt_bundle_example.exe -- memory /tmp/asic-memory
dune runtest
```

Each output directory must be new or empty. The optional third CLI argument is
the source root; it defaults to the current directory. The command reads Git
HEAD and every `.ml`/`.mli` under that root's `lib/`, including its group
subdirectories, plus the example and Dune
declarations. Missing source inputs and a source root without a Git commit fail
before files are written. The command names no sibling checkout.

The memory example uses an explicitly selected four-word, eight-bit flop RAM.
`ui_in[1:0]` is its address, `ui_in[2]` is write enable, `uio_in` is whole-word
write data, `ena` enables access, and `uo_out` is registered read data. It has
no reset or validity port on the RAM; reads of unwritten words are unspecified.
The observable example registers `ui_in` on `clk`, clears on active-low `rst_n`,
and drives zero to `uo_out` when `ena` is low. Its declared input and output
delays (minimum 0 ns; maximum 1 ns on `ui_in`, `rst_n` and `ena`, 2 ns on
`uo_out`) demonstrate typed SDC emission;
these are example assumptions, not values inferred from the TT board. The
minimum of 0 ns is the hold-pessimistic choice for inputs driven asynchronously
to `clk`.

## Bundle layout

Schema-1 manifests include `requested_tools.runtime_policy` in the hashed
payload: host exact-minor Python 3.11 (also used for native execution), and the
official LibreLane 3.1.0.dev3 Docker image with Python 3.10..3.14
(`Requires-Python >=3.10`). Older bundles without it keep strict 3.11 for both
roles. To get the current semantics, **emit a fresh bundle**; never edit a
preserved one. See [runtime policy](flow.md#runtime-policy-and-launch-binding).

```text
OUTPUT/
  info.yaml                 TT metadata, pinout, top, clock and source list
  src/config.json           resolved LibreLane settings
  src/<top>.v               synthesis RTL
  simulation/<top>.v        separately elaborated behavioral simulation RTL
  constraints/top.sdc       typed clock, target constraint environment, and
                            optional min/max I/O delays
  inputs/...                exact copies of declared generator source inputs
  manifest.json             schema version 1, identity and SHA-256 inventory
```

`info.yaml` names the single file under `src/`. `VERILOG_FILES` uses
`dir::<top>.v`, relative to `src/config.json`. The SDC paths use
`dir::../constraints/top.sdc`; the floorplan path uses
`dir::../tt/tech/ihp-sg13cmos5l/def/tt_block_6x4_pgvdd.def`. The pinned TT
[`project.py` at the pinned TT revision](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt-support-tools/blob/da63c9927411e3aca350977d653d24bbf5bca972/project.py)
expects a checkout linked at `OUTPUT/tt` when the physical flow
runs. That checkout, the PDK, LibreLane and the flow runner are external
prerequisites for execution; the bundle itself needs none of them. TT's
`create_user_config` may regenerate derived settings from `info.yaml`; they
originate from the same declaration and must agree with `src/config.json`.
LibreLane's [PnR and signoff SDC variables](https://librelane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/timing_closure/index.html)
consume the generated timing file.

## Generated SDC

Because `PNR_SDC_FILE` and `SIGNOFF_SDC_FILE` point at `constraints/top.sdc`,
LibreLane's `FALLBACK_SDC` never runs, so this file is the whole timing
environment. It is written in a fixed order, with every number formatted to
round-trip exactly, so the same declaration always produces the same bytes:

```tcl
create_clock -name clk -period 20.833333333333336 [get_ports {clk}]
set_clock_uncertainty 0.25 [get_clocks {clk}]
set_clock_transition 0.14999999999999999 [get_clocks {clk}]
set_timing_derate -early 0.94999999999999996
set_timing_derate -late 1.05
set_max_fanout 10 [current_design]
set_driving_cell -lib_cell sg13cmos5l_buf_4 -pin X [get_ports {ena rst_n ui_in uio_in}]
set_driving_cell -lib_cell sg13cmos5l_buf_4 -pin X [get_ports {clk}]
set_load 0.0060000000000000001 [get_ports {uio_oe uio_out uo_out}]
set_input_delay -max 1 -clock clk [get_ports {ena}]
set_input_delay -min 0 -clock clk [get_ports {ena}]
...
```

The clock and the per-port delays come from the project declaration; everything
between them comes from the resolved target's constraint environment and is
documented in [the target reference](../reference/target-reference.md). `set_load` is in the
Liberty `capacitive_load_unit`, which is picofarads for sg13cmos5l, so the 6 fF
`OUTPUT_CAP_LOAD` is divided by 1000 exactly as `base.sdc` does. The six
LibreLane variables behind those lines are also emitted into `src/config.json`
as `Target`-owned settings, so synthesis — which reads `SYNTH_DRIVING_CELL`,
`OUTPUT_CAP_LOAD` and `MAX_FANOUT_CONSTRAINT` outside the SDC — optimises
against the same environment that timing analysis assumes. All of them, plus
`IO_DELAY_CONSTRAINT`, `SYNTH_CLK_DRIVING_CELL`, `MAX_TRANSITION_CONSTRAINT` and
`MAX_CAPACITANCE_CONSTRAINT`, are protected keys: a raw override of one would
either do nothing or move synthesis away from what the SDC analyses.

No `set_propagated_clock` or `unset_propagated_clock` appears, on purpose.
LibreLane's `read_current_sdc` greps the file for both and, finding neither,
unpropagates clocks for pre-CTS analysis and propagates them afterwards.

The two RTL source sets have separate paths and are compiled independently.
For the memory example, the synthesis set contains flop storage without
behavioral poison initialization; the simulation set contains diagnostic
initialization. No consumer should compile both sets together. The manifest
lists each set explicitly and records the resource request, selection reason,
source roles, resolved settings and override reasons.

The manifest identity is SHA-256 of its canonical ordered payload, excluding
the identity field itself. Its file inventory hashes every emitted file except
the manifest. Each declared input has a content hash, Git status, and a copy
under `inputs/`, so dirty and untracked source bytes remain retrievable. Target
references record their role, path, revision, corner and any known hash. The
floorplan has a pinned SHA-256; standard-cell PDK views are external references
whose installed bytes are checked by preflight.
Actual run versions, logs and reports belong to separate execution records.

`dune runtest` regenerates both examples in a temporary Git repository, checks
stable output and content hashes, changes a tracked source and adds an untracked
source to prove manifest identity changes, checks missing-input diagnostics, and
compiles and simulates each RTL source set with Icarus when it is installed.
The testbench is [`test/tt_bundle_tb.v`](../../test/tt_bundle_tb.v). The
[Flow guide](flow.md) covers preflight, isolated execution,
result collection, and physical acceptance evidence.

## Project API regression commands and coverage

From the provider checkout with the existing OCaml tools available:

```sh
python3 test/check_project_api.py --provider-checks
# External integration only, after dune build @install:
python3 test/check_project_api.py
```

`--provider-checks` runs `dune build @install`, full `dune runtest --force`, the
external Resolved_flow checker (eight private-record rejection checks), and the
external Project consumer. It does not install into a shared prefix. The runner
preserves normal PATH, including available `iverilog` and `vvp`; the existing
bundle suite skips optional RTL replay only when those tools are absent. Git
configuration/identity are isolated and inherited Git selectors removed. Temporary
fixture commits use author and committer `Bundle test <bundle@test.invalid>`, with
no remotes. Neither external compiler checker is a Dune `runtest` action: each
builds unrelated consumers against `_build/install/default/lib`.

- `test/test_project.ml`: default empty inventory, declaration-only description,
  pre-design emission rejection, and ordinary elaboration afterward.
- `test/project_api_consumer.ml`: public signatures, exact inventory retention,
  default/explicit-true equivalence, false skipping a rejecting Simulation
  constructor, synthesis-source fallback, construction/resolution/simulation/
  render/write failures, no premature output, and nonempty-output preservation.
- Target overrides cover revisions, floorplan hash and constraints. Observable
  and memory designs each compare high-level emission with manual lower-level
  composition, both with and without Simulation: four complete on-disk bundle
  comparisons, including identity. `examples/tt_bundle_example.ml` remains the
  low-level oracle; the checker copies its declarations and injects test arguments
  only in a temporary consumer. Its separate `let simulation_project =`
  construction remains intact for the existing lower-level checker.
- Those same four bundles also compare `emit_bundle_to_store` against explicit
  emission and manual composition, byte for byte. Publication default/false options
  retain design call counts, and both public record construction and update are
  rejected by the external compiler. Explicit roots and source names include spaces.
- `check_project_api.py` verifies first publication, inode/mtime-preserving repeat
  reuse, exact plain-directory reuse, preserved corrupt/missing/extra/file/empty-dir
  and symlink collisions, store/parent corruption, and forced real write failure
  using POSIX `RLIMIT_FSIZE`. Two independent OCaml processes render before a gate
  releases them into a real publication race, requiring one created result and one
  verified reuse with only one retained object. Preflight/run canonicalization and
  archive bundle selection, hash validation and input-tarball verification exercise
  the root-link layout without executing EDA.

Renaming or copying source inputs legitimately changes bundle identity through
provenance, even when the hardware is byte-identical. Acceptance evidence for the
entry point is recorded in the
[phase plan](../phase_plan.md#project-centered-entrypoint-acceptance).
