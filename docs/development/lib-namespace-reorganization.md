# Reorganize `lib/` into qualified module groups

Status: implemented 2026-10-15, uncommitted in the working tree at the time of
writing; the owner commits. Written 2026-10-14. Decisions revised and the tree
re-surveyed on 2026-10-15 at commit `936e82d`, after the named-flow feature
(`ecbcd57`) landed in `lib/`.

This is a record of the decisions and the change. "Today" in the mapping table
and the [2026-10-15 survey](#survey-2026-10-15) describe the tree before the
change. What was built and how it was verified is in
[Implementation and verification](#implementation-and-verification-2026-10-15).

## Motivation

The number of files in `lib/` is not the problem. `hardcaml/src` is one flat
directory of 73 modules, and Jane Street's convention is that a directory marks
a library boundary rather than a browsing aid. What makes `lib/` hard to read is
structure:

1. **Name collisions.** `lib/flow.ml` (in `hardcaml_asic`) sits next to the
   `lib/flow/` directory, which is a different library
   (`hardcaml_asic.flow_domain`). `lib/timing.ml` and
   `lib/flow/analysis/timing.ml` are unrelated `Timing` modules.
   `flow_stage.ml` mostly re-exports `Hardcaml_asic_flow_domain.Stage_id`.
2. **Nesting points the wrong way.** `lib/flow/` and `lib/execution/` look like
   subfolders of `hardcaml_asic`, but each is its own library. The dependency
   order is `flow_domain` → `hardcaml_asic` → `execution`, so the parent
   directory depends on one child and the other child depends on the parent.
3. **Three conventions in one tree.** The top level is flat, `execution/` uses
   `(include_subdirs unqualified)`, and `flow/` uses `(include_subdirs qualified)`.
4. **No table of contents.** There is no hand-written `hardcaml_asic.ml`, so
   nothing tells a reader how the 25 top-level modules group.

## What the package delivers

The package ships three libraries and an executable. The consumer's library and
the CLI are connected through files on disk rather than through linking:

```text
consumer design repo (e.g. hardcaml_asic_example) — its own executable
  -> links Hardcaml_asic (Project, Tt_cmos5l, Pinout, Bundle, Flow, ...)
  -> writes a bundle directory (RTL + configuration + manifest)
  -> hardcaml-asic-flow (bin/flow_cli; links only unix and yojson)
  -> LibreLane -> physical implementation tools
```

- `hardcaml_asic.flow_domain` is a Core-only description of stages, operations,
  the LibreLane mapping and the named-flow catalog (`Catalog`, `Methodology`,
  `Profile`, `Selection`, `Parameter`). It deliberately has no hardware,
  project or execution dependency: `test/catalog_domain/` and
  `test/stage_domain_consumer.ml` link only it to prove that a client such as
  Workbench can read stage definitions and a project's flow catalog without
  `hardcaml`.
- `hardcaml_asic` is the hardware library consumers link.
- `hardcaml_asic.execution` is the native execution engine behind the CLI and
  the `bin/experimental_*` executables.

One opam package carries all of it so a consumer pinning one revision gets a
library and CLI that agree (see the comment in `flow/dune`).

## Decisions

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| Qualified or unqualified subdirectories for `hardcaml_asic` (2026-10-14) | **Qualified.** Subdirectories become real namespaces (`Hardcaml_asic.Resource.Id`). |
| How consumers reach modules afterwards (2026-10-14) | **Short aliases plus qualified groups.** A hand-written `lib/hardcaml_asic.ml` exposes the groups and also re-exports the consumer entry points at the top level, so consumer code does not change. |
| `hardcaml_asic.flow_domain` (revised 2026-10-15) | **Keep it a separate library.** It moves out of `lib/` to a repo-root `flow_domain/`. Its library name, `public_name` and internal layout are unchanged. This supersedes the 2026-10-14 decision to merge it into `hardcaml_asic`, whose rationale ("keeping it separate spares no one a dependency") stopped holding once the catalog moved into it and gained Core-only consumers. |
| Where `execution` lives (2026-10-14) | **Repo-root `execution/`**, a sibling of `lib/` and `bin/`. Its `public_name` stays `hardcaml_asic.execution` and its internal layout is unchanged. |
| `flow_domain`'s `stages/<stage>/` (2026-10-14) | **Keep as is**, including the small per-step files. |
| Rename `Flow.Operation` (`Synthesis \| Hardening`) to `Goal` (2026-10-15) | **No.** The rename was only needed to avoid a clash with `flow_domain`'s `Operation` after a merge. Without the merge, the curated `Flow` does not re-export the domain `Operation`, so `Flow.Operation` keeps its name and the example's `asic_test/resolution_test.ml` needs no edit. |
| `lib/flow.ml` becomes `lib/flow/config.ml` | **Yes.** It holds the project's flow selection: `t`, `librelane`, `validate`, `Operation`, `Librelane`, `Adapter`. |
| Placement of the four modules added by the named-flow feature (2026-10-15, revised the same day) | **`Plan_json`, `Spec` and `Methodology_inventory` join `Flow`; `Methodology_plan` stays a root module.** All four were first assigned to `Flow`, but `Methodology_plan` depends on `Project` and `Bundle`, which would make `Flow` depend on the groups above it (see constraint 3). |
| Group layering (2026-10-15) | **Groups depend on each other in one direction only:** `Resource`, `Flow` → `Platform` → `Elaboration` → root modules. `Technology` joins `Resource`; `Resolved` and `Bundle` join `Elaboration`; `Project`, `Methodology_plan` and `Single_port_ram` stay at the `lib/` root. This replaces the 2026-10-14 grouping, which had group-level cycles. `Elaboration` could also hold `Project` and `Methodology_plan` without a cycle; they stay at the root by choice, as the layer that composes every group, so `Elaboration` does not become a catch-all. |
| Implementation without git mutations (2026-10-15) | **Use plain `mv`, not `git mv`.** The implementation session makes no commits, adds or other index changes; the owner commits. Git detects the renames at commit time as long as moved files are not also heavily edited in the same commit. |

## Constraints verified with dune 3.17

Both were tested in a scratch project, not in this repository.

1. **A library stanza is not allowed under a `(include_subdirs qualified)`
   directory.** dune reports: *"This stanza is not allowed in a sub-directory of
   directory with (include_subdirs qualified). Hint: add (include_subdirs no)"*.
   So `flow_domain` and `execution` cannot stay nested under a qualified `lib/`.
   The opt-out hint works, but it would keep the misleading nesting, and
   `lib/flow/` is also the natural directory for `hardcaml_asic`'s own `Flow`
   group.
2. **A file named after its directory becomes that group's interface module.**
   For example, `resource/resource.ml` becomes `Resource`, and it must re-export
   every member itself. The groups depend on each other (`Tt_cmos5l` uses
   `Flow`; `Bundle` uses `Target`), so such interface modules create dependency
   cycles. **Rule: no group directory contains a file with its own name.** That
   rules out `target/target.ml` and `flow/flow.ml`, which is why one group is
   called `platform/` and `flow.ml` becomes `flow/config.ml`.
3. **Dependencies are tracked per group, not per module (found 2026-10-15
   during implementation, reproduced with dune 3.24.2).** A reference such as
   `B.Z.t` from a module in group `A` makes it depend on every module in group
   `B`. So any two groups that reference each other produce a dune
   "Dependency cycle between: transitive deps of …" error, even when no
   module-level cycle exists. A three-file scratch project (`a/x.ml`,
   `a/y.ml` using `B.Z.t`, `b/z.ml` using `A.X.t`) reproduces it. The 2026-10-14
   version of this record assumed module-level resolution; that was wrong.
   **Rule: the groups must form a DAG.** Root modules of `lib/` are individual
   nodes and may depend on any group, but no group module may depend on a root
   module.

## Target layout

```text
flow_domain/                  library hardcaml_asic.flow_domain (moved from lib/flow/)
  stage_id, operation, registry, catalog, methodology, profile, selection,
  parameter, stages/, analysis/, backends/librelane/
lib/                          library hardcaml_asic, (include_subdirs qualified)
  dune
  hardcaml_asic.ml            curated public surface (see below)
  project.ml                  root modules: may use any group
  methodology_plan.ml
  single_port_ram.ml
  resource/                   id request policy technology selection record
  flow/                       config stage recipe plan_json spec methodology_inventory
                              (hardcaml_asic's Flow group, not the domain library)
  platform/                   harness target clock pinout timing tt_cmos5l
  elaboration/                mode context metadata elaborated_project resolved bundle
execution/                    library hardcaml_asic.execution (moved from lib/execution/)
bin/                          executables, unchanged
flow/                         Python CLI and runtime data, unchanged
```

The three libraries sit side by side in dependency order. Repo-root `flow/` is
already the Python CLI package, which is why the domain library is called
`flow_domain/` rather than reusing that name.

The groups come from the actual `ocamldep` graph of the top-level modules,
arranged so that group dependencies run one way:

```text
Resource ──┐
           ├─> Platform ─> Elaboration ─> root (Project, Methodology_plan, Single_port_ram)
Flow ──────┘
```

`Platform` uses `Resource` (`Target` → `Technology`) and `Flow` (`Tt_cmos5l` →
`Config`). `Elaboration` uses all three. `Resource` and `Flow` use neither
each other nor anything above them.

### Module mapping

| Today | New qualified path | Top-level alias in `hardcaml_asic.ml` |
|---|---|---|
| `Resource_id` | `Resource.Id` | — |
| `Resource_request` | `Resource.Request` | — |
| `Resource_policy` | `Resource.Policy` | `Resource_policy` (used by the example) |
| `Resource_record` | `Resource.Record` | — |
| `Selection` | `Resource.Selection` | — |
| `Technology` | `Resource.Technology` | `Technology` (used by the example; added in step 5) |
| `Single_port_ram` | root module, unchanged | `Single_port_ram` |
| `Target` | `Platform.Target` | `Target` |
| `Harness` | `Platform.Harness` | — |
| `Tt_cmos5l` | `Platform.Tt_cmos5l` | `Tt_cmos5l` |
| `Pinout` | `Platform.Pinout` | `Pinout` |
| `Clock` | `Platform.Clock` | `Clock` |
| `Timing` (`lib/timing.ml`) | `Platform.Timing` | `Timing` |
| `Project` | root module, unchanged | `Project` |
| `Elaboration_context` | `Elaboration.Context` | — |
| `Elaboration_mode` | `Elaboration.Mode` | — |
| `Elaborated_project` | `Elaboration.Elaborated_project` | `Elaborated_project` |
| `Metadata` | `Elaboration.Metadata` | — |
| `Flow` (`lib/flow.ml`) | `Flow.Config` | merged into curated `Flow`, see below |
| `Flow_stage` | `Flow.Stage` | via curated `Flow` |
| `Flow_recipe` | `Flow.Recipe` | via curated `Flow` |
| `Resolved_flow` | `Elaboration.Resolved` | `Resolved_flow` (used by the example) |
| `Bundle` | `Elaboration.Bundle` | `Bundle` |
| `Plan_json` | `Flow.Plan_json` | — |
| `Flow_spec` | `Flow.Spec` | `Flow_spec` (used by the example; added in step 5) |
| `Methodology_inventory` | `Flow.Methodology_inventory` | — |
| `Methodology_plan` | root module, unchanged | `Methodology_plan` (used by the example) |

Since the groups become namespaces, the `Resource_*`, `Elaboration_*` and
`Flow_*` prefixes would stutter, so they are dropped.

`Hardcaml_asic_flow_domain.*` names do not change. The curated `Flow` keeps
re-exporting `Catalog`, `Methodology`, `Profile`, `Selection` and `Parameter`
from it, as `lib/flow.ml` does today. It does not re-export `Stage_id`,
`Operation`, `Registry`, `Stages`, `Analysis` or `Backends`.

**Placement of the four named-flow modules (decided 2026-10-15).** `Plan_json` has no
intra-library dependencies and `Bundle` uses it. `Flow_spec` uses `Flow` and
`Plan_json`. `Methodology_inventory` uses `Plan_json`. Those three join `Flow`.
`Methodology_plan` uses `Project`, `Bundle`, `Elaborated_project`,
`Resolved_flow`, `Flow`, `Flow_spec`, `Methodology_inventory` and `Plan_json`;
in `Flow` it would make `Flow` depend on `Elaboration` and on `Project`, so it
stays a root module beside `Project`.

**Keeping the layering.** A new module joins the lowest group that all of its
dependencies allow. If a module in a lower group would need something from a
higher group, the module belongs higher (or at the root), not the dependency
lower. `Platform.Tt_cmos5l` depends on `Flow.Config` because the TT template
supplies default LibreLane overrides; it does not depend on `Target`.

### `lib/hardcaml_asic.ml`

Once this file exists, only what it re-exports is public. It must expose all
four groups, the aliases from the table, and everything `execution/`, `bin/`,
`test/` and `examples/` reference. Use `(** {1 ...} *)` sections, as
`hardcaml/src/hardcaml.ml` does. Its structure as implemented, without the doc
comments (the file itself is authoritative):

```ocaml
(** {1 Groups} *)

module Resource = Resource
module Platform = Platform
module Elaboration = Elaboration

(** Flow selection, stages, recipes and plan serialization. Includes
    [Flow.Config] so [Flow.librelane], [Flow.validate], [Flow.t] and
    [Flow.Operation] keep working, and re-exports the catalog modules from
    [Hardcaml_asic_flow_domain]. *)
module Flow = struct
  include Flow
  include Flow.Config
  module Catalog = Hardcaml_asic_flow_domain.Catalog
  module Methodology = Hardcaml_asic_flow_domain.Methodology
  module Profile = Hardcaml_asic_flow_domain.Profile
  module Selection = Hardcaml_asic_flow_domain.Selection
  module Parameter = Hardcaml_asic_flow_domain.Parameter
end

(** {1 Consumer entry points} *)

module Project = Project
module Methodology_plan = Methodology_plan
module Single_port_ram = Single_port_ram
module Elaborated_project = Elaboration.Elaborated_project
module Target = Platform.Target
module Tt_cmos5l = Platform.Tt_cmos5l
module Pinout = Platform.Pinout
module Clock = Platform.Clock
module Timing = Platform.Timing
module Resource_policy = Resource.Policy
module Technology = Resource.Technology
module Resolved_flow = Elaboration.Resolved
module Bundle = Elaboration.Bundle
module Flow_spec = Flow.Spec
```

Things to check while writing it:

- `include Flow` followed by `include Flow.Config` must not produce duplicate
  names. `Config` carries `t`, `librelane`, `validate`, `Operation`,
  `Librelane` and `Adapter`. The group's members are `Config`, `Stage`,
  `Recipe`, `Plan_json`, `Spec` and `Methodology_inventory`, so nothing
  clashes. The added catalog modules do not clash either: `Methodology` and
  `Methodology_inventory` are distinct names.
- Today `lib/flow.ml` both defines the configuration and re-exports `Stage`,
  `Recipe` and the catalog modules. After the move, `flow/config.ml` keeps only
  the configuration; the re-exports move into the curated `Flow` above.
- Inside the library, modules refer to groups through dune's generated alias
  module (`Flow.Config`, `Platform.Target`), not through the curated `Flow`.
  Internal callers of the old `Flow.t` and `Flow.Operation`
  (`elaborated_project`, `project`, `resolved_flow`, `tt_cmos5l`, `bundle`,
  `flow_spec`, `methodology_plan`) change to `Flow.Config.t` and
  `Flow.Config.Operation`. Root modules refer to each other by plain name.

## Consumer impact

Usage measured at `936e82d`:

- **`hardcaml_asic_example`** (separate repo, `~/devel/jane/hardcaml_asic_example`)
  uses `Flow.*` (58 references: `Catalog`, `Parameter`, `Selection`, `Stage`,
  `Profile`, `Methodology`, `Recipe`, `Operation`), `Tt_cmos5l`,
  `Methodology_plan` (in `bin/project.ml`), `Bundle`, `Timing`,
  `Resolved_flow` and `Pinout`. With the aliases above, **no edit is
  required**. Still rebuild it and follow the
  [consumer dependency workflow](consumer-dependency-workflow.md) to move its
  pin. This survey's grep missed the example's uses of `Technology` and
  `Flow_spec`; both became top-level aliases during step 5.

  **Correction (2026-10-15, after commit `ad290d8`):** the example's OCaml needs
  no edit, but its dependency script does. `scripts/asic_dependency.py` checks
  provider source and installed `.mli` files at fixed flat paths
  (`lib/elaborated_project.mli`, `lib/flow/catalog.mli`, …) and the spelling of
  types in `project.mli`, so a development refresh of `ad290d8` was refused
  before building. The script now selects a `flat` or `grouped` layout and
  refuses a mix; its setup tests cover both (22 tests). That change is in the
  example repo, not here. With it, a development refresh of `ad290d8` followed
  by the `standard`/`balanced` named flow through signoff and accepted
  finalization passed: six stages in 26 min 27 s, finalization 669.6 s,
  DRC/LVS/antenna, TT precheck and the 11,429-row gate replay all pass, and
  cells, area and slack match
  [the previous physical evidence](../../evidence/librelane-observation/native-final-integration.json)
  exactly. Results are under the example's
  `_flow_results/reorg-ad290d8-20261015/` (not curated evidence).
- **References inside this repo to modules that lose their top-level name.**
  These either get a qualified path or, if a name is wanted publicly, an alias:

  | File | Modules |
  |---|---|
  | `bin/experimental_stages.ml` | `Methodology_plan` |
  | `examples/memory_example.ml` | `Elaboration_mode`, `Resource_id`, `Selection`, `Technology` |
  | `examples/tt_bundle_example.ml` | `Technology` |
  | `lib/execution/backends/librelane/stage_preparation.ml(i)` | `Methodology_plan` |
  | `lib/execution/methodology_execution_record.ml(i)` | `Methodology_plan`, `Plan_json` |
  | `lib/execution/methodology_execution_service.ml(i)` | `Methodology_plan`, `Methodology_inventory` |
  | `lib/execution/results/finalization_service.ml` | `Methodology_plan` |
  | `lib/execution/results/historical_methodology.ml` | `Methodology_plan` |
  | `lib/execution/results/stage_execution_record.ml` | `Methodology_plan` |
  | `test/fixture.ml` | `Elaboration_context`, `Resource_id`, `Resource_record`, `Resource_request`, `Selection`, `Technology` |
  | `test/named_observation_race.ml` | `Methodology_plan` |
  | `test/plan_contract/consumer.ml` | `Flow_spec`, `Technology` |
  | `test/project_api_consumer.ml` | `Elaboration_context`, `Elaboration_mode`, `Technology` |
  | `test/stage_preparation_consumer.ml` | `Methodology_plan` |
  | `test/test_lifecycle.ml` | `Elaboration_context`, `Elaboration_mode`, `Resource_id`, `Resource_record` |
  | `test/test_resolved_flow.ml` | `Metadata`, `Technology` |
  | `test/test_selection.ml` | `Elaboration_mode`, `Resource_record`, `Selection`, `Technology` |
  | `test/test_single_port_ram.ml` | `Elaboration_mode`, `Resource_id`, `Resource_record`, `Resource_request`, `Selection`, `Technology` |
  | `test/test_target.ml` | `Technology` |

  `Methodology_plan` remains a top-level name, so the execution and `bin/`
  uses keep working. The rest
  are mostly tests of internal modules and should use qualified paths
  (`Hardcaml_asic.Resource.Record`), not new aliases.
  `test/catalog_domain/catalog_domain_consumer.ml` uses the domain library's
  own `Selection` and is unaffected.
- **`Hardcaml_asic_flow_domain` references are unaffected.** The library name
  and installed library list do not change, so `execution/`, `test/dune`,
  `test/catalog_domain/`, `test/stage_domain_consumer.ml` and
  `test/check_stage_domain.py` need no edits for the move.
- **Source path strings.** No code, dune file or test hard-codes `lib/flow` or
  `lib/execution`. Only `README.md` (lines 153–154, the layout table) names
  them.
- **Docs** that name the old modules or paths include `README.md`,
  `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/phase_plan.md`,
  `docs/guides/ocaml-stage-recipes.md`, the `docs/guides/` flow pages, and §5 of
  [flow-infrastructure-refactor](../flow-infrastructure-refactor.md). §5's
  status note places stage domains under `lib/flow/` and execution under
  `lib/execution/`; update it to match this record. Dated records under
  `docs/development/` stay as historical text.

## Order of work

Work on a branch from a clean `main`, one commit per step. Run
`dune build -j 20` and `dune runtest -j 20 --force` after each step.

1. **Move `lib/execution/` to `execution/`.** A pure move. The dune file
   and `public_name` stay unchanged.
2. **Move `lib/flow/` to `flow_domain/`.** A pure move. The dune file,
   library name and `public_name` stay unchanged. After this step `lib/` holds
   only `hardcaml_asic`.
3. **Create the groups.** Switch `lib/dune` to `(include_subdirs qualified)`.
   Create `resource/`, `platform/`, `elaboration/` and `flow/` with the renames
   from the mapping table: `flow.ml` to `flow/config.ml` (moving its
   `Stage`/`Recipe`/catalog re-exports out, see above), `flow_stage` to
   `flow/stage`, `flow_recipe` to `flow/recipe`, `flow_spec` to `flow/spec`,
   `plan_json` and `methodology_inventory` into `flow/`, `technology` into
   `resource/`, and `resolved_flow` to `elaboration/resolved`, `bundle` to
   `elaboration/bundle`. `project`, `methodology_plan` and `single_port_ram`
   stay at the root. Update internal references.
4. **Add `lib/hardcaml_asic.ml`** with the groups and aliases. Add a `.mli` if
   the surface should be documented separately.
5. **Update `execution/`, `test/`, `bin/` and `examples/`** using the table in
   [Consumer impact](#consumer-impact). Then rebuild `hardcaml_asic_example`
   against the new revision.
6. **Update the docs** listed above, and add this record to the
   `docs/README.md` index under completed work.

Steps 3 and 4 cannot build separately in practice: once `lib/` is qualified,
consumers see only the generated group aliases until `hardcaml_asic.ml` exists.
Either combine them in one commit, or add `hardcaml_asic.ml` in step 3 and
treat step 4 as its documentation pass.

Do not reformat files while moving them, and keep content edits to what the
move requires, so the owner can commit renames separately from content changes
and `git log --follow` keeps history. Per the decisions above, moves use plain
`mv`; the implementation session does not run `git mv`, `git add` or commits.

Converting `execution/` from `(include_subdirs unqualified)` to qualified is a
separate later change (decided 2026-10-15). It would rename the library's public
modules (`Hardcaml_asic_execution.*`), so it stays out of this reorganization.

Missing `.mli` files are a separate follow-up, not part of this change. These
modules have none: `flow.ml`, `selection`, `resource_record`, `pinout`,
`clock`, `timing`, `metadata`, `harness`, `elaboration_mode`, and in
`flow_domain`, `analysis/timing` and `stages/*`.

## Survey (2026-10-15)

Taken at `936e82d` on `main`. `lib/` was unchanged by the docs-only commits
after `ecbcd57`.

**Baseline.** `dune build -j 20` and `dune runtest -j 20 --force` both exited 0
(the test run took about 9 minutes). Uncommitted documentation edits were
present in the working tree; no source or dune file was modified.

**Size.** `lib/` without `execution/` is 8,467 lines; `lib/execution/` is
7,220 lines. There are 85 `.ml` files in all.

**Libraries and `include_subdirs` modes.** Unchanged from 2026-10-14:
`lib/dune` (flat, depends on `hardcaml_asic.flow_domain`), `lib/flow/dune`
(qualified, `core` only), `lib/execution/dune` (unqualified, C stubs).

**`flow_domain` contents.** `stage_id`, `operation`, `registry`, `catalog`,
`methodology`, `profile`, `selection`, `parameter`, `analysis/timing`,
`backends/librelane/mapping`, and `stages/{synthesis,floorplan,placement,cts,routing,signoff}/recipe`
plus placement's `global_placement`, `design_repair` and `detailed_placement`.
The catalog, methodology, profile, selection and parameter modules were added by
`ecbcd57`.

**Top-level dependency graph** (intra-library only; `[fd]` marks a direct
`Hardcaml_asic_flow_domain` reference):

`lib/execution/execution_plan.ml` and `classic_contract.ml`,
`segment_service.ml`, `stage_preparation.ml` under
`lib/execution/backends/librelane/`. Tests: `test/dune`,
`test/stage_domain_consumer.ml`, `test/check_stage_domain.py`,
`test/catalog_domain/{dune,catalog_domain_consumer.ml}`. Docs: `README.md`,
`docs/architecture.md`, `docs/phase_plan.md`,
`docs/guides/ocaml-stage-recipes.md` and dated development records. None of
these change under the revised plan except the docs that name source paths.

## Implementation and verification (2026-10-15)

Steps 1–5 were done together in the working tree on `main`, with plain `mv`
and no git index changes, rather than as one commit per step on a branch.

**Built.** `lib/execution/` moved to repo-root `execution/` and `lib/flow/` to
`flow_domain/`, both with unchanged dune files, library names and module names;
`execution/` still uses `(include_subdirs unqualified)`. `lib/` is
`(include_subdirs qualified)` with the `resource/`, `flow/`, `platform/` and
`elaboration/` groups and root modules from the [target layout](#target-layout),
and `lib/hardcaml_asic.ml` is the curated surface shown above. `Flow.Operation`
kept its name. Code in `execution/`, `bin/`, `test/` and `examples/` uses
qualified paths for internal modules (`Resource.Record`, `Elaboration.Mode`,
`Flow.Plan_json`).

**Verified.** `dune build` of the whole repo and `dune runtest -j 20 --force`
pass. The separate `hardcaml_asic_example` builds and passes its tests against
this working tree with no source edits.

**Non-OCaml fixes the survey did not predict.** Bundle source identity and two
Python checks assumed a flat `lib/`:

- `examples/tt_bundle_example.ml` `source_inputs` now walks `lib/` recursively,
  so bundle source identity still covers the whole library;
  `test/check_project_api.py` takes that function from the example's source
  text, so it picks up the change without an edit;
- `test/check_bundle.py` now targets `lib/elaboration/elaborated_project.ml`;
- comment-only path updates in `toolchain.lock`, `scripts/flow.sh` and
  `flow/hardcaml_asic_flow/data/toolchain.sh`.

**Fixed 2026-10-15.** The manual `test/check_methodology_legacy.py` (not part
of `runtest`) broke: it overwrote `lib/{project,resolved_flow}.ml(i)` with frozen
`0d04bae` versions in a copy of the current `lib/`, which no longer contains
`flow_domain/` and is no longer flat. It now takes `lib/` and `dune-project` via
`git archive` from `--environment-ref` (default `0ed1b3d`, the last
pre-reorganization commit), applies the same splice there, and builds the
*current* `examples/tt_bundle_example.ml`, so both emitters share the recursive
`source_inputs`. To compile against both layouts the example now names the
top-level alias `Technology` instead of `Resource.Technology`. The manual `test/check_project_api.py` was not run.

Comments and doc strings in moved files may still name modules by their old
names in prose (for example `Resolved_flow`, `Resource_id`,
`Elaboration_context`); only references that the compiler checks were updated.
