# hardcaml_asic phase plan

**Current queue, adopted 2026-10-24: make the ASIC flow usable for
`hardcaml_protemu`'s SRAM-backed implementation and resource studies.**

This is the only active implementation queue. [Architecture](architecture.md)
owns boundaries; the [memory contract](reference/program-memory-contract.md)
owns RAM semantics. Detailed designs and evidence belong in `development/`,
`sram/`, and `evidence/`, linked from the relevant item here.

**Revised direction, 2026-10-24:** ongoing SRAM acceptance belongs in
`hardcaml_asic_example` through public APIs. The old Verilog probe remains a
diagnostic/history artifact. Do not add architectural registers or change latency
implicitly; permit recorded behavior-preserving physical optimization. The
[example integration plan](development/sram-example-integration.md) records the
agent assignments and blog-backed KLayout/CDL checking approach.

The previous plan is preserved in the [2026-10-24 archive](archive/phase-plan-2026-10-24.md),
including completed milestones, open P6 gates, and the former next steps.
Archiving an open item does not complete it. New work uses **ASIC PT.0–PT.8**
to avoid renumbering historical ASIC P/S tasks or Protemu's own phases.

## Current baseline

- Project/resource declaration, behavioral and flop RAM implementations, immutable
  bundles, execution/reporting/acceptance, explicit stages, and named flow profiles
  are delivered. Their evidence remains in the archives.
- Protemu's `bin/asic_bundle.ml` registers `program` as 256×16, 1RW, latency one,
  currently with explicit `Flops` policy. Its emitter still uses
  `Bundle.render ~simulation_build`; current ASIC uses `~simulation_project`.
- CMOS5L now has an exact 256×16 SRAM mapping, role-complete collateral and fresh
  synthesis/full support. The independent example passes physical/electrical
  acceptance, TT precheck and final-gate functional replay while retaining one SRAM
  and its original 16 staging flops. Macro checkpoints and timed-model conformance
  remain open.
- SRAM S.1 inventory, S.2a functional-model tests, and qualified S.3 physical
  feasibility have evidence. The [October 23 checkpoint](sram/sram-status.md#2026-10-23-update)
  resolves eligibility and records the support-tools marker fix. Production
  physical support is demonstrated for the exact example profile; timed-model
  conformance remains open. Earlier authority-gate wording
  in historical records is superseded by that update.
- Workbench already has flow integration, synthesis cell tables, timing and
  physical inspection. The new work is logical-resource mapping and its connection
  to implementation evidence; see its [current overview](../../hardcaml_workbench/README.md).

Current implementation evidence is in the [physical closeout](development/sram-example-physical.md#implementation--execution-record)
and [earlier synthesis record](development/sram-example-integration.md#evidence).

## Ownership

| Owner | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `hardcaml_asic` | Resource contracts and selection, macro wrappers/collateral, physical and timing intent validation, backend rendering, mapping evidence, public inspection interfaces |
| `hardcaml_protemu` | Hardware parameters, program packing, loading/fetch validity, synchronization architecture, project policy/placement/constraints, workloads and whole-system verification |
| `hardcaml_workbench` | Discovery and presentation of ASIC-owned data; resource browsing, comparison and user controls through public provider interfaces |

ASIC must remain usable headlessly and must not depend on Workbench. Cross-repo
items below are coordination deliverables; their implementation lives with the
named owner and does not reuse that repository's phase IDs.

## Active queue

| Order | Item | Dependencies | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | PT.0 — Repair and refresh SRAM feasibility evidence | Existing S.3 records | Complete in revised example-centered scope; historical probe qualifications retained |
| 2 | PT.1 — Exact production SRAM backend | PT.0 corrected power/corner findings | Required scope complete; PT.1d optional/deferred |
| 3 | PT.2 — Macro collateral and physical controls | PT.1 mapping/wrapper contract | Complete for stock 256×16/R0 fresh full profile; example acceptance passed |
| 4 | PT.3 — Macro-backed Protemu acceptance | Required PT.1 scope and PT.2; consumer API migration | Pending; independent consumer-adoption track |
| 5 | PT.4 — Resource-mapping inspection API | Existing records; PT.1–PT.2 for macro fields | Complete: CLI/library preparation and independent-example acceptance |
| 6 | PT.5 — Requested-versus-realized resource checks | PT.2, PT.4 | Complete in supported retained-evidence scope: reconciliation, physical measurements and sampled resource timing |
| 7 | PT.6 — Workbench resource inspector | PT.4; PT.5 for realized evidence | Delivered: bounded Resources inspector, exact sources, qualified comparison and declared controls |
| 8 | PT.7 — Synchronizer/reset-aware timing declarations | Endpoint reference design; independent example acceptance | Complete in agreed bounded library/example synthesis scope; physical qualification tracked separately |
| 9 | PT.8 — Reproducible design-variant comparisons | PT.4–PT.7 for generic infrastructure; PT.3 for consumer selection | Bounded library/example declarations and checked pair comparison accepted; workload/consumer selection pending |

This is the preferred execution order, not a requirement to serialize design
work. PT.4 can begin against existing flop records; PT.7 can begin independently.
PT.3 can establish functional integration before PT.7, but final Protemu physical
selection requires reviewed timing constraints. Workbench is optional for all
headless acceptance. Serialize Dune builds with `-j 20` and keep external-tool
resource use within the same shared budget.

## PT.0 — Repair and refresh SRAM feasibility evidence

**Owner: ASIC. First bounded task: correct the S.3 power bridges and corner map.**

Implementation started 2026-10-24; see the [agent-sized implementation plan](development/pt0-implementation.md)
for assignments, the `hardcaml_asic_example` testbed, resource limits and evidence.

- [x] **PT.0a — Power access.** Correct the two misplaced VPWR bridge rectangles;
  re-extract and verify adequate contact to both positive supply pins and ground.
  Completed 2026-10-24: emitted GDS/DEF show 1.95 µm positive-pin contact and
  0.28 µm adjacent-ground clearance; zero extraction overlap and correct extracted
  supplies. The first proposed shift exposed a real spacing defect, corrected by
  narrowing both bridges. [Evidence](../evidence/sram-pt0/README.md).
- [x] **PT.0b — Corner binding.** Replace ambiguous corner globs with validated
  mappings. Record the actual macro Liberty loaded in every STA corner, including
  the standard-cell/macro fast-corner temperature difference; rerun affected STA.
  Completed 2026-10-24: exact single-match libraries confirmed in corner-only and
  fresh physical STA; setup/hold pass in every corner. Fast −40/−55 °C model
  difference remains explicit. [Evidence](../evidence/sram-pt0/README.md#corners-and-timing).
- [x] **PT.0c — Residuals and retained evidence.** Reassess macro-boundary slew/cap
  violations with correct corners and buffer/resize as necessary. Recheck the
  LEF-obstruction DRC finding against real GDS. Preserve routed DEF, P&R netlist,
  extracted SPICE, reports, exact inputs and restoration instructions in a new
  evidence set; retain the original archive and digest unchanged.
  Partial 2026-10-24: a verified/restored 8.38 MB evidence archive now retains the
  required physical views and attribution runs; all nine current TT prechecks
  pass. Fresh flow exits 2 on three abstract Magic M3.f markers. Slew violations
  remain (fast/slow/typical: 12/25/21), with 12 capacitance violations per corner.
  Retained-GDS Magic reports 29,294 macro-internal findings requiring a deck/model
  disposition in that historical probe. **Closed 2026-10-25 in the revised public
  example scope:** all-corner slew/cap pass without changed limits or registers;
  real-GDS KLayout is clean; three abstract Magic markers have exact layer-control
  disposition; power/LVS and external TT/gate checks pass. The original probe is
  not relabeled as clean. [Closeout and retained evidence](development/sram-example-physical.md).

The [example's registered-memory specimen](../../hardcaml_asic_example/memory/README.md)
now exercises public Exact selection, actual vendor-functional RTL and the
technology-mapped and routed netlists. Unsupported shapes still fail explicitly.
Physical acceptance now applies to its exact stock R0 profile, not arbitrary memories.

**Exit:** the known probe defects have corrected, reproducible evidence, with
remaining findings explicitly dispositioned. This supplements S.3's qualified
closure; it does not relabel that historical probe as production acceptance.
Use the [S.3 disposition](sram/sram-s3-disposition.md) for technical detail and
the October 23 checkpoint for current authority/pin context.

## PT.1 — Exact production SRAM backend

**Owner: ASIC. Implements the production mapping portion of historical S.4.**

- [x] **PT.1a — Mapping and wrapper.** Map the existing 256×16 latency-one 1RW
  request exactly to `RM_IHPSG13_1P_256x16_c2_bm_bist`. Implement enables,
  whole-word mask and BIST/test tie-offs, with stable wrapper/instance names.
- [x] **PT.1b — Contract conformance.** Run the shared contract suite against the
  behavioral, flop and actual macro functional models. Compare only defined
  results; check each backend's own hold behavior after writes and disabled cycles.
  Preserve no reset, no initialization, and simulation-only poison behavior.
- [x] **PT.1c — Selection diagnostics.** Exercise `Exact`, explicit `Flops`, and
  explicitly permitted fallback. Unsupported contracts fail under `Exact`;
  fallback records its reason. No silent dimension rounding or macro composition.
  PT.1a–c completed 2026-10-24: canonical request, injective resource names,
  direct macro instantiation without new registers, three-backend contract replay
  (2,307 edges each), unsupported-shape/fallback diagnostics, independent example
  RTL and mapped-netlist replay. [Record](development/sram-example-integration.md#evidence).
- [ ] **PT.1d — Timed-model conformance (optional, deferred).** Establish a simulator path that executes
  the macro's delayed timing checks, with positive and intentional-violation
  cases. Keep this evidence separate from functional tests and Liberty STA.
  Owner decision, 2026-10-25: this is not a completion gate for the supported
  backend, PT.2 or Protemu adoption. No competition/vendor requirement for it has
  been established. Reactivate for a specific timing-sensitive verification gap,
  an explicit external requirement, or a deliberate decision to qualify/rely on
  the vendor timed model. Questa is the intended candidate when available;
  installation and whole-chip SDF simulation are not current prerequisites.

**Exit:** supported exact requests elaborate to the production wrapper and pass
functional backend conformance and selection diagnostics (PT.1a–c). **Required
scope is complete.** PT.1d remains unperformed optional work, not a claimed pass.
Correct Liberty/corner/constraint handling, STA/electrical checks and physical
acceptance remain required for implementation; making timed simulation optional
does not weaken those checks.

## PT.2 — Macro collateral and physical controls

**Owner: ASIC; project settings supplied by Protemu.**

- [x] **PT.2a — Collateral lifecycle.** Register, resolve, validate and identify
  synthesis black boxes, functional/timed models, Liberty corners, LEF, GDS and
  CDL/SPICE. Keep simulation and synthesis source roles distinct. Resolve PDK
  files at the appropriate execution/preflight boundary, not ordinary elaboration.
  Completed 2026-10-24: generated synthesis stub, separate behavioral/functional/
  timed roles, exact corners and PDK-file identity checked at preflight and after
  execution. Runtime resource/instance consistency and mutation negatives pass.
- [x] **PT.2b — LibreLane integration.** Derive `MACROS`, corner bindings, layout
  assembly and macro-aware LVS inputs from registered resources. Connect
  `VDD!`/`VDDARRAY!` to `VPWR` and ground to `VGND` through the supported target
  integration. Record the accepted target assumptions and actual connectivity.
  Completed 2026-10-25: placement-aware edge power access verified in final GDS;
  exact corners, real-GDS KLayout and actual schematic CDL consumption verified.
  LVS scope is abstract macro-boundary/interconnect, not internal-device LVS.
- [x] **PT.2c — Placement intent.** Add resource-ID-keyed position, orientation,
  halo/clearance and supported power-grid controls. Validate target bounds,
  overlap, legal orientations and unknown resource references. Support multiple
  explicitly declared instances with distinct identities; start with manual placement.
  Completed for R0 with a common halo and the checked Metal4 edge-access strategy.
  Dynamic pin/grid/OBS validation rejects unsupported geometry. Multi-resource
  generation/negative fixtures pass; actual physical acceptance is one example macro.
- [x] **PT.2d — Physical acceptance.** Run a normal emitted macro bundle through
  synthesis, physical implementation, required checks and TT precheck using the
  current pinned support tools. Verify actual corner binding, power access,
  macro-boundary electrical limits and CDL-backed LVS. Preserve complete evidence.
  Completed 2026-10-25: run `be961b2c95f74c81ad6af81ca4d2b269`, external postcheck
  `0553f6d19c8f42d28c057fc65ed23510`, consumer audit and restored replay pass.
  Worst setup/hold: **11.246561 / 0.223533 ns**. Raw Magic=3, narrowly dispositioned;
  routing/KLayout/overlap/electrical/LVS/antenna checks pass. [Physical record](development/sram-example-physical.md).

**Exit:** the normal library/CLI path implements the exact macro reproducibly
without hand-editing emitted bundles or borrowing experimental configuration.
Missing collateral, ambiguous corners and invalid placement produce actionable errors.

## PT.3 — Macro-backed Protemu acceptance

**Owners: Protemu for adoption/system checks; ASIC for backend defects and evidence.**

**Next bounded step: PT.3a.** Audit the current Protemu emitter and dependency
record, migrate to the supported public API, and emit explicit flop and exact-SRAM
variants with the same logical memory contract. Verify deterministic source sets,
resource identity and selection before running expensive physical work. Use the
accepted example as the integration reference; no Questa installation is needed.

- [ ] **PT.3a — Consumer adoption.** Migrate Protemu's emitter to the current public
  API and deliberately adopt a compatible dependency/toolchain revision. Preserve
  an explicit flop configuration and add an exact-SRAM configuration for `program`.
- [ ] **PT.3b — Real system regression.** Exercise the loader/core/program-store
  path: load, readback, fetch, stalls, reset/disable, image validity, rejected host
  accesses during execution, and independence from unspecified memory outputs.
  Verify both emitted source roles with the applicable models.
- [ ] **PT.3c — Implemented-design replay.** Run the actual macro-backed system
  through the adopted flow and replay its final netlist with the macro model.
  Record timing/check outcomes and any provisional constraint assumptions;
  an RTL-only fixture is not final-netlist evidence.

**Exit:** the actual Protemu system works with the selected SRAM and has linked
consumer/backend/run evidence. Final physical selection additionally requires
PT.7's reviewed constraints and PT.8's configuration decision. Historical small
observable-top and flop-memory measurements do not substitute for this gate.

## PT.4 — Resource-mapping inspection API

**Owner: ASIC. Extend existing records rather than introduce another selector.**

Completed 2026-10-25: [preparation operation contract, agent slices and evidence](development/resource-preparation.md).
This is a first-class overall-workflow preparation operation, not another LibreLane
physical stage. CLI/library and independent-example testing come first; Workbench
integration is outside this implementation slice. PT.3 adoption is not a prerequisite.

- [x] **PT.4a — Pre-run inventory.** Expose a versioned, machine-readable
  CLI/provider view available without EDA: resource ID, requested contract,
  matched policy, selected implementation, fallback/rejection explanation,
  and actual elaboration role (behavioral versus selected implementation).
- [x] **PT.4b — Physical linkage.** Include generated wrapper/macro instance
  identities, required collateral and corners, placement and supply intent.
  Distinguish unresolved references from validated files and measured facts.
- [x] **PT.4c — Stable provenance.** Bind inspection to exact source/configuration/
  circuit/preparation identities; support deterministic output and historical inspection. Verify
  flop, macro, fallback and unsupported-selection cases headlessly.
  Preparation occurs before bundle emission: no bundle identity is fabricated.
  Linking a separately emitted bundle requires explicit future verification.

Delivered `Project.prepare_resources`, structured pure resource snapshots, durable
attempt lifecycle, `preparation1` capability and the installed `preparation-inspect`
reader. Example `prepare`/`preview`/`resources` cover memory and resource-free FIFO.
All **89 installed-consumer checks** and both repositories' full test suites pass
with their documented historical/opt-in fixture limits. Original v1 attempts remain
readable; current workflow descriptor v2 reports actual phases. No Workbench changes.
See the [operating guide](guides/resource-preparation.md).

**Exit:** a client can answer “what will `program` become, and why?” without
parsing RTL or running synthesis. Simulation inventory cannot be mistaken for
the implementation selected for fabrication.

## PT.5 — Requested-versus-realized resource checks

**Owner: ASIC; Workbench consumes the results.**

Implementation authorized 2026-10-26 after separate flow work finished:
[bounded assignments, shared evidence contract and acceptance plan](development/resource-realization-plan.md).
Preparation selects resources, bundle emission binds expectations, and synthesis/
physical result checks establish realization. Separate PT.4-attempt linkage is
optional and unavailable unless verified. Reconciliation, physical measurements and
sampled resource timing are now delivered in the supported evidence scope below.
Library/CLI and the independent example are the testbed;
Protemu adoption and Workbench integration are independent.

- [x] **PT.5a — Reconciliation.** Check expected macro type/count/identity against
  synthesis and final physical instances. Report missing, unexpected, unresolved
  and optimized-away instances distinctly, retaining stage and producer identity.
  Delivered 2026-10-27 for supported flat mapped/final-netlist evidence; unsupported
  hierarchy is unresolved, and absence never implies optimization. New bundles bind
  a structured snapshot to their exact resolution; historical inventories remain
  explicitly legacy. Separate PT.4 attempt linkage is optional/unavailable.
- [x] **PT.5b — Resource evidence.** Report macro versus standard-cell area,
  utilization and links to macro-boundary timing paths. Attribute flop-resource
  costs only where the mapping survives synthesis; otherwise report unavailable.
  **Completed in supported scope, 2026-10-27:** schema 2 provides checker/DEF-bound
  macro footprint, optional exact LEF-class component sums, explicit gross-core/die
  ratios, and resource-linked sampled timing paths/slew/output loads. Existing
  synthesis estimates and native rounded physical metrics remain distinct. Final
  installed acceptance: 15 tests, 186 sampled paths / 372 electrical observations,
  complete 76-reference archive closure and historical schema-1 replay. No EDA rerun.
  [Contract and closeout](development/resource-measurements-plan.md#implementation-and-acceptance-closeout).
  Coverage remains the validated stock/R0 physical checker and retained native
  post-PNR report format; unsupported inputs are unavailable/diagnosed. Flop ownership,
  exhaustive timing, per-pin compliance margins, usable-site utilization, IR/EM and
  resource power remain unestablished—not implied by gross-area ratios or sampled links.
- [x] **PT.5c — Acceptance integration.** Make required-macro mismatches fail the
  relevant implementation checks, with negative fixtures and actual-run evidence.
  Completed 2026-10-27: public library/CLI, collection/report and archive validation;
  corrected installed example passed 20 focused tests / 76 API-CLI calls, preserving
  276 historical files. Both full suites passed with documented fixture limits.
  Independent review defects were corrected and reverified. See the
  [closeout](development/resource-realization-plan.md#implementation-and-review-closeout-2026-10-27)
  and [operating guide](guides/resource-realization.md).

**Exit:** selected mapping and verified implementation are separate inspectable
facts. A declaration alone cannot establish that a run retained its SRAM.

## PT.6 — Workbench resource inspector

**Owner: Workbench; ASIC owns and tests the public data contract.**

Implementation authorized 2026-10-28. [Cross-repository integration contract](../../hardcaml_workbench/docs/resource_inspector_plan.md)
defines typed bundle/coarse/execution/finalization targets, bounded index/detail/source
queries, explicit historical import and Resources workspace acceptance. Existing
PT.5 raw inspection remains compatible; UI does not duplicate selection/reconciliation.

- [x] **PT.6a — Resource table.** Display resource identity, shape/contract, policy,
  implementation and selection reason, distinguishing explicit flops from fallback.
- [x] **PT.6b — Drilldown.** Link a logical resource to its hierarchy, collateral,
  placement and realized-mapping/timing evidence; show unavailable or pending data.
- [x] **PT.6c — Controls and comparison.** Compare two configurations/runs and
  expose project-supported selection controls through public preview/new-build
  interfaces. Do not mutate immutable bundles or duplicate selection logic in UI.

Delivered 2026-10-28: provider-owned `resource-inspect` bounded bridge and Resources
workspace with explicit bundle/coarse/execution/finalization sources, paged details
and authorized artifacts. Exact A/B captures compare selection differences and
compatible Observed/Derived scalars; estimates/unknowns have no measured delta.
Controls reuse project-advertised flow/profile/assignments; unsupported memory-policy
knobs and automatic variant sweeps are not introduced. Actual augmented SRAM UI
acceptance verifies `program`, stock macro, matched synthesis/final observations,
physical area and sampled paths; empty FIFO and unavailable historical inventory
are distinct. [Operating guide](../../hardcaml_workbench/docs/resource_inspector.md),
[acceptance](../../hardcaml_workbench/docs/resource_inspector_acceptance.md).
Both full suites and independent correction review pass. Named-checkpoint realization,
unlinked preparation history and PT.5b physical/timing limits remain explicit; no EDA
or new named macro execution is claimed. Application provider upgrade was separately
approved; user visual acceptance after restart remains distinct from native PTY proof.

**Exit:** selecting `program` shows its contract, selected macro and whether the
chosen run actually retained it. The same facts remain available headlessly.

## PT.7 — Synchronizer/reset-aware timing declarations

Started 2026-10-28: [bounded implementation plan and shared contract](development/pt7-timing-intent.md).
Generic library/example acceptance is independent of Protemu adoption. Consumer-specific
protocol/reset/I/O review remains pending and is not authorized in this slice.

**Closeout decision:** PT.7 is complete in its documented library/example synthesis
scope. The original checklist requires implemented declarations, post-synthesis
endpoint resolution and reviewable evidence; it does not require routed timing
closure or exhaustive classification of every timing-check context. Existing
coverage limitations and negative hold observations remain unchanged.

Separate follow-up issue drafts (GitHub publication blocked by missing CLI authentication):

- [All-corner pre-PNR timing qualification](development/ticket-all-corner-timing.md).
- [Post-PNR preservation and timing closure](development/ticket-post-pnr-timing.md),
  using the first ticket's reviewed corner/model policy.

These are physical-qualification follow-ups, not additional PT.7 completion gates.
**Physical follow-up accepted, 2026-10-29:**
[bounded all-corner/physical qualification plan](development/timing-physical-qualification.md).
One ordinary coarse full run of the unchanged five-register example closed setup,
hold, slew and capacitance at fast/typical/slow cell-PVT corners using the nominal
extracted RC view. Ordinary post-CTS repair added nine combinational delay cells,
no registers or latency. The 20 ns period, 0.25 ns uncertainty and I/O environment
remain unchanged. Named physical support remains deferred.

Run `23a6954b852d4205b542d3815634d772`, build
`ac513e0e7e9cfa935f73d697caebca8f601aeeb4ea62c2a2ccf61c10a10789cd`:

| Cell corner, nominal RC | Worst setup ns | Worst hold ns | Setup/hold/slew/cap violations |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Fast | +16.058595 | +0.102353 | All zero |
| Typical | +15.729074 | +0.276686 | All zero |
| Slow | +15.113664 | +0.590927 | All zero |

Routing/Magic DRC, antenna and LVS pass; all nine TT checks and 512 final-netlist
functional observations pass. Exact extracted inputs, clock propagation, qualified
five-stage paths and separate native coverage/closure outcomes are retained.
Corrected public archives restore all 423 raw artifacts with exact public response
parity and original PDK/source hidden. [Actual evidence](../../hardcaml_asic_example/docs/timing_physical_full_result.md),
[independent final review](development/timing-physical-final-review.md).
This is this example/profile's physical timing acceptance, not arbitrary designs,
all RC extremes, analog reset/CDC adequacy or Protemu qualification. Original
synthesis hold failures remain unchanged historical evidence. Physical execution
provider `4856e6af993642988c18c07f47a8c689` is distinct from archive correction
provider `1ba205c2a11c4904b03d98b0e7a3f616`; no second P&R run was needed.
Exhaustive per-check/effect instrumentation remains a documented limitation, to be
promoted only for a concrete requirement. Consumer-specific review belongs to PT.3
and the consumer's final physical-selection acceptance.

**Owners: ASIC for declarations, validation/rendering and evidence; example for
generic acceptance; Protemu for its separate circuit intent and consumer review.**

- [x] **PT.7a — Endpoint references (bounded subset).** Exact scalar/bit inputs and
  registered scalar Q anchors resolve after synthesis to supported CMOS5L pins.
  Empty/ambiguous/merged/unsupported matches and changed clock/data/reset connectivity
  reject before applying exceptions. Native bit/scalar acceptance completed 2026-10-28.
- [x] **PT.7b — Narrow timing intent (bounded subset).** Reasoned external capture
  to one first-stage D and enumerated externally active-low/reset-to-zero controls;
  requested Yosys `keep=1` preserves five original stages in the tested mapping.
  All three sampled downstream setup/hold links remain timed. No automatic state
  insertion, general false paths, blanket chain exceptions or physical-preservation claim.
- [x] **PT.7c — Reviewable evidence (bounded scope).** Delivered identity-covered requested intent,
  producer-reported resolution, command-completed application, hash-bound raw reports
  and strict read-only library/CLI inspection for standalone synthesized-netlist audits.
  **Accepted 2026-10-28:** [native-state/coarse-flow slice](development/pt7c-native-flow.md).
  New identity-covered producers collect native `write_sdc` state, seven category-bound
  diagnostic groups and native endpoint inventory. The reader verifies exact stored
  relations, native design and full returned diagnostics without executing Tcl.
  Ordinary macro-free coarse synthesis runs a separate linked STAPrePNR analysis;
  collect/report/inspection/archive replay bind exact run/build/synthesis/runtime/
  libraries/corner/producer sources, without rerender or current PDK lookup.
  **Outside this completed scope:** exhaustive exception effects/per-check analysis
  and separately tracked post-PNR/other-corner acceptance. Current evidence proves stored
  scope and bounded capture-witness suppression, not all affected paths or reset
  effect/adequacy. Overall inspection remains **exit 1 / unavailable**; ordinary
  synthesis report exit 0 is not a timing-closure verdict.
  **Named synthesis accepted:** [bounded integration and closeout](development/pt7-named-synthesis.md).
  Fresh area/delay profiles bind exact frozen methodology, attempt, occurrence and
  promoted checkpoint State to required linked STA; early expectation/failure evidence,
  checkpoint preservation and public report/inspection parity are independently checked.
  Named evidence remains path-bound; named archives and physical endpoints are unsupported.
- [ ] **Consumer review (separate pending track).** Review Protemu's protocol inputs,
  sampled host link, reset and board/pad I/O assumptions, then rerun affected physical
  checks. No Protemu inspection, modification or timing-correctness claim in this slice.

Accepted example provider `74e9a52b43a14c69bff2763325b39522`, source snapshot
`a6723afb6a88bce6152d7b05662ea614a6e1a75352b870b4e20391e7c2d3f684`.
Fresh audits `sta-bit-r3` and `sta-scalar-r3` use Yosys 0.66 / OpenSTA 2.7.0,
typical CMOS5L corner and unmodified public-bundle SDC. Sampled setup is
**+19.432287 ns**, hold **−0.044244 ns (violated)**; this proves sampled timing
preservation, not closure. No P&R was run. Native lookup/boundary-net and evidence
validation defects found after initial suites passed were fixed and retested;
all earlier failures remain retained.
[Operating guide](guides/timing-intent.md),
[actual example evidence](../../hardcaml_asic_example/docs/pt7_timing_final.md),
[independent final review](development/pt7-final-review.md).

PT.7c native-v2 coarse run `83a02bdcb4b34f22bbc03b0ec5223b41`, bundle
`9d01f5c006c697dd103762c04038fd73e8322d3b546f2bf56dfcad0de19cc8c6`, retains five
stages, six exact stored relations, seven explicit diagnostic categories and 12
endpoints. Actual execution provider `4d4316e3a33942c2a577d6f55acaa34a` is separate
from final corrected inspector `4c9ae1a7a50444179c8ab69469443c19`; the reader-only
LF grammar fix replays the unchanged native artifacts. Native controls expose
removed/restricted capture exceptions and missing delays/clocks. Declared downstream
hold is still −0.044244 ns; broader native min samples reach −0.243063 ns. No timing
closure or P&R is claimed. [Native evidence](../../hardcaml_asic_example/docs/pt7c_native_v2_final.md),
[final reader qualification](../../hardcaml_asic_example/docs/pt7c_reader_r1b_final.md),
[independent final review](development/pt7c-final-review.md).
The intermediate native-v1 format is explicitly unsupported by the current reader;
its frozen provider/history remain intact. Original standalone audit schema1 retains
its original supported semantics.

Named native attempts `cb5e7cd92dbf43b4a6c00a74b61c6d72` (area) and
`9374823306a64897959e1b2295f52c84` (delay) each preserve five stages, six relations,
seven categories and 12 endpoints. All seven checkpoint files remain unchanged;
1584 verified sources include 1062 explicit declared-path/canonical-target alias
proofs without dropping the conservative PDK closure. Provider generation
`ce6be246fafa4d0dbe1dd00da980482b` produced both runs. The final external-pin
validation correction was reader/publisher-only; current helpers replay both
unchanged outputs, separately identified from their execution provider.
[Native acceptance](../../hardcaml_asic_example/docs/pt7named_native_final.md),
[corrected-reader receipt](../../hardcaml_asic_example/docs/pt7named_reader_r4_final.md),
[independent review](development/pt7-named-final-review.md).
Both profiles retain −0.044244 ns downstream hold violations. No P&R or closure claim.

**Exit:** generic implemented hardware has reviewed, traceable constraints with
explicit coverage and producer limitations. Protemu's final physical selection
additionally requires its own consumer review and affected checks. Digital
phase-sweep tests and ordinary STA do not establish analog metastability reliability.

## PT.8 — Reproducible design-variant comparisons

Generic library/example first slice accepted 2026-10-29:
[bounded variant/comparison plan](development/pt8-variant-plan.md).
Hardware assignments remain distinct from resource policy and existing flow
profiles. New declarations plus read-only evidence comparisons do not establish
Protemu parameter conformance, workload equivalence or final configuration selection.
Consumer-specific PT.8a–c obligations below stay pending independently.

- [x] **Library/example foundation:** checked typed `Hardware_variant`,
  `Project.of_variant` factory association, optional identity-covered manifest metadata
  and historical absence semantics. Depth128/256 adapter behavior and a deliberate
  ignored-depth failure are independently exercised; hashes alone are not conformance.
- [x] **Read-only pair comparison:** public library/CLI over explicit bundle/coarse/
  execution targets, declared axis, exact source identities/differences/outcomes,
  per-metric comparable/confounded/unavailable reasons and eligible right-minus-left
  deltas. Existing parsers/source replay are reused; no winner or tool execution.
- [ ] **Workload/result contract:** verified logical workload, exact variant-specific
  artifacts and producer/measurement semantics for firmware size, fetch counts,
  latency and throughput. These metrics remain unavailable in comparison schema1.

Corrected installed provider `f205e0d66f8d4f2b8d1e5f098171bb21`, source snapshot
`1f5ac45882b29c7d577937b4ba2eb8960a899bd2221eaae5b3e115a111de3213`.
204 example assertions and18 targeted correction cases pass. Six functional
simulations include five positives and an ignored-depth conformance failure;
no EDA. Independent reviews corrected unchecked coarse input copies, unsafe stored
metadata reads, missing raw-generation fencing and duplicate-field loss before
archive validation. Existing named-macro preparation remains unsupported.

[comparison review](development/pt8-comparison-review.md).

**Owners: Protemu for variants/workloads; ASIC for identities/results;
Workbench for optional launch and comparison views.**

- [ ] **PT.8a — Variant declarations.** Parameterize supported memory shapes,
  packing/encoding, FIFO depths, engine configuration and clocks in Protemu.
  Record hardware parameters separately from resource policy and flow profiles.
  Reject unsupported exact mappings; larger/multiple-macro mappings require their
  own explicit capability and conformance work.
- [ ] **PT.8b — Comparable results.** Link firmware size, fetch counts, latency and
  throughput to the exact variant, bundle, flow profile and run. Compare mapped
  and physical area, slack, utilization and acceptance with consistent workloads;
  keep estimates, synthesis evidence and physical evidence distinct.
- [ ] **PT.8c — Selection gate.** Run promising candidates with PT.7 constraints,
  record resource/timing margin and choose the Protemu configuration. Rerun
  affected regressions and preserve reproducible inputs/results for that choice.

**Exit:** Protemu's P5 studies can compare explicit flops and supported SRAM
configurations without ad hoc edits or ambiguous provenance. Existing named-flow
profiles are reused rather than rebuilt as a second experiment system.

## Milestones

1. **Usable macro path:** PT.0–PT.3 complete; real Protemu requests and implements
   an exact SRAM through the ordinary flow, with backend/system acceptance.
2. **Inspectable mappings:** PT.4–PT.6 complete; Workbench and headless clients
   show requested, selected and realized resources with provenance.
3. **Physical selection ready:** bounded PT.7, PT.8, separately qualified all-corner/
   post-PNR timing and consumer review support the selected configuration. Bounded
   PT.7 completion alone is not physical timing acceptance.

Automatic banking/shape adaptation, automatic floorplan optimization, SRAM-backed
tiny FIFOs/register files, new targets and general flow scheduling are outside this
queue unless a concrete consumer requirement promotes them.

## Previous work and retained obligations

The [archived queue](archive/phase-plan-2026-10-24.md#active-queue) retains
per-operation invocation, configuration-changing checkpoint reuse, consumer pin
adoption and source cleanup. These are deferred, not completion claims. Promote
only a concrete dependency of the PT work; record that decision here.

<a id="asic-p6--shared-tooling-distribution"></a>

**ASIC P6:** source-artifact identity, waiver/provisioning authority and independent
installation gates remain open at their [recorded status](archive/phase-plan-2026-10-24.md#asic-p6--shared-tooling-distribution).
Keep P6 IDs when resuming them. Packaging already delivered is not new PT work.

**ASIC P7/S/T:** [historical definitions and disposition](archive/phase-plan-2026-10-24.md#asic-p7-s-and-t--retained-independent-tracks)
remain available. PT.0 supplements S.3; PT.1–PT.2 deliver S.4's production work
without claiming the remaining S.2 timed-model gate passed. Reassess the ABC issue
only for measurements affected by it. See also the [backlog](backlog/README.md).

## Recording progress

- Mark an item complete only with its stated evidence; distinguish partial
  implementation, functional verification, physical execution and acceptance.
- Add dated evidence links beside completed PT items. Keep detailed commands,
  tool/source identities and findings in the relevant feature record.
- Keep ordinary tests PDK-free; run physical/model-tool acceptance explicitly.
- Preserve historical IDs and archived evidence. Update this queue when priorities
  change, and archive it before the next substantial replacement.
